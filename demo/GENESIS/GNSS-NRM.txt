[GNSS|0001]Genesis 1,1 In
[GNSS|0002]the beginning God
[GNSS|0003]created the heaven
[GNSS|0004]and the earth.


[GNSS|0005]1,2 Now the earth was
[GNSS|0006]unformed and void,
[GNSS|0007]and darkness was upon
[GNSS|0008]the face of
[GNSS|0009]the deep;


[GNSS|000A]and the spirit
[GNSS|000B]of God hovered
[GNSS|000C]over the face
[GNSS|000D]of the waters.


[GNSS|000E]1,3 And God said: 'Let
[GNSS|000F]there be light.'
[GNSS|0010]And there was light.


[GNSS|0011]1,4 And God saw
[GNSS|0012]the light, that it was
[GNSS|0013]good;


[GNSS|0014]and God divided
[GNSS|0015]the light from
[GNSS|0016]the darkness.


[GNSS|0017]1,5 And God
[GNSS|0018]called the light Day,
[GNSS|0019]and the darkness He
[GNSS|001A]called Night.


[GNSS|001B]And there was
[GNSS|001C]evening and there was morning,
[GNSS|001D]one day.


[GNSS|001E]{P}  1,6
[GNSS|001F]And God said: 'Let there
[GNSS|0020]be a firmament in
[GNSS|0021]the midst of
[GNSS|0022]the waters, and let it
[GNSS|0023]divide the waters from
[GNSS|0024]the waters.' 1,7
[GNSS|0025]And God made
[GNSS|0026]the firmament, and
[GNSS|0027]divided the waters
[GNSS|0028]which were under
[GNSS|0029]the firmament from
[GNSS|002A]the waters which were above
[GNSS|002B]the firmament;


[GNSS|002C]and it was so. 1,8
[GNSS|002D]And God called
[GNSS|002E]the firmament Heaven.


[GNSS|002F]And there was
[GNSS|0030]evening and there was morning,
[GNSS|0031]a second day.


[GNSS|0032]{P}  1,9
[GNSS|0033]And God said: 'Let
[GNSS|0034]the waters under
[GNSS|0035]the heaven be
[GNSS|0036]gathered together unto one place,
[GNSS|0037]and let the dry land
[GNSS|0038]appear.' And it was so.
[GNSS|0039]1,10 And God
[GNSS|003A]called the dry land Earth,
[GNSS|003B]and the gathering together
[GNSS|003C]of the waters
[GNSS|003D]called He Seas;


[GNSS|003E]and God saw that it
[GNSS|003F]was good.


[GNSS|0040]1,11 And God said: 'Let
[GNSS|0041]the earth put forth grass,
[GNSS|0042]herb yielding seed,
[GNSS|0043]and fruit-tree bearing fruit
[GNSS|0044]after its kind,
[GNSS|0045]wherein is the seed thereof,
[GNSS|0046]upon the earth.'
[GNSS|0047]And it was so. 1,12
[GNSS|0048]And the earth brought forth
[GNSS|0049]grass, herb yielding seed
[GNSS|004A]after its kind,
[GNSS|004B]and tree bearing fruit,
[GNSS|004C]wherein is the seed thereof,
[GNSS|004D]after its kind;


[GNSS|004E]and God saw that it
[GNSS|004F]was good.


[GNSS|0050]1,13 And there was
[GNSS|0051]evening and there was morning,
[GNSS|0052]a third day.


[GNSS|0053]{P}  1,14
[GNSS|0054]And God said: 'Let there
[GNSS|0055]be lights in
[GNSS|0056]the firmament of
[GNSS|0057]the heaven to divide
[GNSS|0058]the day from
[GNSS|0059]the night;


[GNSS|005A]and let them be
[GNSS|005B]for signs, and
[GNSS|005C]for seasons, and
[GNSS|005D]for days and years;


[GNSS|005E]1,15 and let them be
[GNSS|005F]for lights in
[GNSS|0060]the firmament of
[GNSS|0061]the heaven to give light
[GNSS|0062]upon the earth.'
[GNSS|0063]And it was so. 1,16
[GNSS|0064]And God made
[GNSS|0065]the two great lights:
[GNSS|0066]the greater light to rule
[GNSS|0067]the day, and
[GNSS|0068]the lesser light to rule
[GNSS|0069]the night;


[GNSS|006A]and the stars.


[GNSS|006B]1,17 And God set them
[GNSS|006C]in the firmament
[GNSS|006D]of the heaven to give
[GNSS|006E]light upon the earth, 1,18
[GNSS|006F]and to rule
[GNSS|0070]over the day
[GNSS|0071]and over the night,
[GNSS|0072]and to divide
[GNSS|0073]the light from
[GNSS|0074]the darkness;


[GNSS|0075]and God saw that it
[GNSS|0076]was good.


[GNSS|0077]1,19 And there was
[GNSS|0078]evening and there was morning,
[GNSS|0079]a fourth day.


[GNSS|007A]{P}  1,20
[GNSS|007B]And God said: 'Let
[GNSS|007C]the waters swarm
[GNSS|007D]with swarms of
[GNSS|007E]living creatures, and let fowl
[GNSS|007F]fly above the earth in
[GNSS|0080]the open firmament
[GNSS|0081]of heaven.' 1,21
[GNSS|0082]And God created
[GNSS|0083]the great sea-monsters,
[GNSS|0084]and every living creature that
[GNSS|0085]creepeth, wherewith the waters swarmed,
[GNSS|0086]after its kind,
[GNSS|0087]and every winged fowl
[GNSS|0088]after its kind;


[GNSS|0089]and God saw that it
[GNSS|008A]was good.


[GNSS|008B]1,22 And God
[GNSS|008C]blessed them, saying: 'Be fruitful,
[GNSS|008D]and multiply, and fill
[GNSS|008E]the waters in
[GNSS|008F]the seas, and let fowl
[GNSS|0090]multiply in the earth.' 1,23
[GNSS|0091]And there was
[GNSS|0092]evening and there was morning,
[GNSS|0093]a fifth day.


[GNSS|0094]{P}  1,24
[GNSS|0095]And God said: 'Let
[GNSS|0096]the earth bring forth
[GNSS|0097]the living creature
[GNSS|0098]after its kind, cattle,
[GNSS|0099]and creeping thing,
[GNSS|009A]and beast of
[GNSS|009B]the earth after its kind.'
[GNSS|009C]And it was so. 1,25
[GNSS|009D]And God made
[GNSS|009E]the beast of
[GNSS|009F]the earth after its kind,
[GNSS|00A0]and the cattle
[GNSS|00A1]after their kind,
[GNSS|00A2]and every thing that creepeth
[GNSS|00A3]upon the ground
[GNSS|00A4]after its kind;


[GNSS|00A5]and God saw that it
[GNSS|00A6]was good.


[GNSS|00A7]1,26 And God said: 'Let
[GNSS|00A8]us make man in our
[GNSS|00A9]image, after our likeness;


[GNSS|00AA]and let them
[GNSS|00AB]have dominion over
[GNSS|00AC]the fish of
[GNSS|00AD]the sea, and
[GNSS|00AE]over the fowl
[GNSS|00AF]of the air,
[GNSS|00B0]and over the cattle,
[GNSS|00B1]and over all
[GNSS|00B2]the earth, and
[GNSS|00B3]over every creeping
[GNSS|00B4]thing that creepeth upon
[GNSS|00B5]the earth.' 1,27
[GNSS|00B6]And God created man in
[GNSS|00B7]His own image, in
[GNSS|00B8]the image of God
[GNSS|00B9]created He him;


[GNSS|00BA]male and female
[GNSS|00BB]created He them.


[GNSS|00BC]1,28 And God
[GNSS|00BD]blessed them;


[GNSS|00BE]and God said unto them:
[GNSS|00BF]'Be fruitful, and multiply,
[GNSS|00C0]and replenish the earth,
[GNSS|00C1]and subdue it;
[GNSS|00C2]and have dominion
[GNSS|00C3]over the fish
[GNSS|00C4]of the sea,
[GNSS|00C5]and over the fowl
[GNSS|00C6]of the air,
[GNSS|00C7]and over every
[GNSS|00C8]living thing that creepeth upon
[GNSS|00C9]the earth.' 1,29
[GNSS|00CA]And God said: 'Behold, I
[GNSS|00CB]have given you every herb
[GNSS|00CC]yielding seed, which is upon
[GNSS|00CD]the face of all
[GNSS|00CE]the earth, and every tree,
[GNSS|00CF]in which is
[GNSS|00D0]the fruit of
[GNSS|00D1]a tree yielding seed-to you
[GNSS|00D2]it shall be
[GNSS|00D3]for food;


[GNSS|00D4]1,30 and to every beast
[GNSS|00D5]of the earth,
[GNSS|00D6]and to every fowl
[GNSS|00D7]of the air,
[GNSS|00D8]and to every
[GNSS|00D9]thing that creepeth upon
[GNSS|00DA]the earth, wherein there is
[GNSS|00DB]a living soul, [I
[GNSS|00DC]have given] every green herb
[GNSS|00DD]for food.' And it was
[GNSS|00DE]so. 1,31 And God saw
[GNSS|00DF]every thing that He
[GNSS|00E0]had made, and, behold, it
[GNSS|00E1]was very good.


[GNSS|00E2]And there was
[GNSS|00E3]evening and there was morning,
[GNSS|00E4]the sixth day.


[GNSS|00E5]{P}  2,1
[GNSS|00E6]And the heaven
[GNSS|00E7]and the earth were finished,
[GNSS|00E8]and all the host
[GNSS|00E9]of them.


[GNSS|00EA]2,2 And on
[GNSS|00EB]the seventh day God
[GNSS|00EC]finished His work
[GNSS|00ED]which He had made;


[GNSS|00EE]and He rested on
[GNSS|00EF]the seventh day from all
[GNSS|00F0]His work which He
[GNSS|00F1]had made.


[GNSS|00F2]2,3 And God
[GNSS|00F3]blessed the seventh day,
[GNSS|00F4]and hallowed it;
[GNSS|00F5]because that in it He
[GNSS|00F6]rested from all His work
[GNSS|00F7]which God in
[GNSS|00F8]creating had made.


[GNSS|00F9]{P}  2,4
[GNSS|00FA]These are the generations
[GNSS|00FB]of the heaven
[GNSS|00FC]and of the earth
[GNSS|00FD]when they were created, in
[GNSS|00FE]the day that
[GNSS|00FF]the LORD God
[GNSS|0100]made earth and heaven.


[GNSS|0101]2,5 No shrub
[GNSS|0102]of the field was
[GNSS|0103]yet in the earth,
[GNSS|0104]and no herb
[GNSS|0105]of the field
[GNSS|0106]had yet sprung up;
[GNSS|0107]for the LORD God
[GNSS|0108]had not caused it to
[GNSS|0109]rain upon the earth,
[GNSS|010A]and there was
[GNSS|010B]not a man to
[GNSS|010C]till the ground;


[GNSS|010D]2,6 but there
[GNSS|010E]went up a mist from
[GNSS|010F]the earth, and
[GNSS|0110]watered the whole face
[GNSS|0111]of the ground.


[GNSS|0112]2,7 Then the LORD God
[GNSS|0113]formed man of
[GNSS|0114]the dust of
[GNSS|0115]the ground, and
[GNSS|0116]breathed into his nostrils
[GNSS|0117]the breath of life;


[GNSS|0118]and man became
[GNSS|0119]a living soul.


[GNSS|011A]2,8 And the LORD God
[GNSS|011B]planted a garden eastward, in
[GNSS|011C]Eden;


[GNSS|011D]and there He put
[GNSS|011E]the man whom He
[GNSS|011F]had formed.


[GNSS|0120]2,9 And out
[GNSS|0121]of the ground
[GNSS|0122]made the LORD God to
[GNSS|0123]grow every tree that is
[GNSS|0124]pleasant to the sight,
[GNSS|0125]and good for food;


[GNSS|0126]the tree of life
[GNSS|0127]also in the midst
[GNSS|0128]of the garden,
[GNSS|0129]and the tree
[GNSS|012A]of the knowledge
[GNSS|012B]of good and evil.


[GNSS|012C]2,10 And a river
[GNSS|012D]went out of Eden to
[GNSS|012E]water the garden;


[GNSS|012F]and from thence it was
[GNSS|0130]parted, and became four heads.


[GNSS|0131]2,11 The name
[GNSS|0132]of the first is Pishon;


[GNSS|0133]that is it
[GNSS|0134]which compasseth the whole land
[GNSS|0135]of Havilah, where there is
[GNSS|0136]gold;


[GNSS|0137]2,12 and the gold
[GNSS|0138]of that land is good;


[GNSS|0139]there is bdellium
[GNSS|013A]and the onyx stone.


[GNSS|013B]2,13 And the name
[GNSS|013C]of the second river is
[GNSS|013D]Gihon;


[GNSS|013E]the same is it that
[GNSS|013F]compasseth the whole land
[GNSS|0140]of Cush.


[GNSS|0141]2,14 And the name
[GNSS|0142]of the third river is
[GNSS|0143]Tigris;


[GNSS|0144]that is it
[GNSS|0145]which goeth toward
[GNSS|0146]the east of Asshur.


[GNSS|0147]And the fourth river is
[GNSS|0148]the Euphrates.


[GNSS|0149]2,15 And the LORD God
[GNSS|014A]took the man,
[GNSS|014B]and put him into
[GNSS|014C]the garden of Eden to
[GNSS|014D]dress it and to keep
[GNSS|014E]it. 2,16 And
[GNSS|014F]the LORD God
[GNSS|0150]commanded the man, saying: 'Of
[GNSS|0151]every tree of
[GNSS|0152]the garden thou mayest freely
[GNSS|0153]eat;


[GNSS|0154]2,17 but of
[GNSS|0155]the tree of
[GNSS|0156]the knowledge of good
[GNSS|0157]and evil, thou shalt
[GNSS|0158]not eat of it;
[GNSS|0159]for in the day that
[GNSS|015A]thou eatest thereof thou shalt
[GNSS|015B]surely die.' 2,18
[GNSS|015C]And the LORD God said:
[GNSS|015D]'It is not good that
[GNSS|015E]the man should be alone;


[GNSS|015F]I will make him
[GNSS|0160]a help meet
[GNSS|0161]for him.' 2,19
[GNSS|0162]And out of
[GNSS|0163]the ground the LORD God
[GNSS|0164]formed every beast
[GNSS|0165]of the field,
[GNSS|0166]and every fowl
[GNSS|0167]of the air;


[GNSS|0168]and brought them unto
[GNSS|0169]the man to see
[GNSS|016A]what he would call them;


[GNSS|016B]and whatsoever the man
[GNSS|016C]would call every
[GNSS|016D]living creature, that was to
[GNSS|016E]be the name thereof.


[GNSS|016F]2,20 And the man gave
[GNSS|0170]names to all cattle,
[GNSS|0171]and to the fowl
[GNSS|0172]of the air,
[GNSS|0173]and to every beast
[GNSS|0174]of the field;


[GNSS|0175]but for Adam there was
[GNSS|0176]not found a help meet
[GNSS|0177]for him.


[GNSS|0178]2,21 And the LORD God
[GNSS|0179]caused a deep sleep to
[GNSS|017A]fall upon the man,
[GNSS|017B]and he slept;


[GNSS|017C]and He took one
[GNSS|017D]of his ribs,
[GNSS|017E]and closed up
[GNSS|017F]the place with flesh
[GNSS|0180]instead thereof.


[GNSS|0181]2,22 And the rib,
[GNSS|0182]which the LORD God
[GNSS|0183]had taken from
[GNSS|0184]the man, made He
[GNSS|0185]a woman, and brought her
[GNSS|0186]unto the man.


[GNSS|0187]2,23 And the man said:
[GNSS|0188]'This is now bone
[GNSS|0189]of my bones,
[GNSS|018A]and flesh of my flesh;


[GNSS|018B]she shall be
[GNSS|018C]called Woman, because she was
[GNSS|018D]taken out of Man.' 2,24
[GNSS|018E]Therefore shall a man leave
[GNSS|018F]his father and his mother,
[GNSS|0190]and shall cleave unto his
[GNSS|0191]wife, and they shall be
[GNSS|0192]one flesh.


[GNSS|0193]2,25 And they were both
[GNSS|0194]naked, the man
[GNSS|0195]and his wife,
[GNSS|0196]and were not ashamed.


[GNSS|0197]3,1 Now the serpent was
[GNSS|0198]more subtle than any beast
[GNSS|0199]of the field
[GNSS|019A]which the LORD God
[GNSS|019B]had made.


[GNSS|019C]And he said unto
[GNSS|019D]the woman: 'Yea, hath God
[GNSS|019E]said: Ye shall
[GNSS|019F]not eat of any tree
[GNSS|01A0]of the garden?' 3,2
[GNSS|01A1]And the woman
[GNSS|01A2]said unto the serpent: 'Of
[GNSS|01A3]the fruit of
[GNSS|01A4]the trees of
[GNSS|01A5]the garden we may eat;


[GNSS|01A6]3,3 but of
[GNSS|01A7]the fruit of
[GNSS|01A8]the tree which is in
[GNSS|01A9]the midst of
[GNSS|01AA]the garden, God hath said:
[GNSS|01AB]Ye shall not eat
[GNSS|01AC]of it, neither shall ye
[GNSS|01AD]touch it, lest ye die.'
[GNSS|01AE]3,4 And the serpent
[GNSS|01AF]said unto the woman: 'Ye
[GNSS|01B0]shall not surely die;


[GNSS|01B1]3,5 for God doth know
[GNSS|01B2]that in the day ye
[GNSS|01B3]eat thereof, then your eyes
[GNSS|01B4]shall be opened,
[GNSS|01B5]and ye shall be
[GNSS|01B6]as God, knowing good
[GNSS|01B7]and evil.' 3,6
[GNSS|01B8]And when the woman saw
[GNSS|01B9]that the tree was good
[GNSS|01BA]for food, and that it
[GNSS|01BB]was a delight to
[GNSS|01BC]the eyes, and that
[GNSS|01BD]the tree was to be
[GNSS|01BE]desired to make one wise,
[GNSS|01BF]she took of
[GNSS|01C0]the fruit thereof,
[GNSS|01C1]and did eat;


[GNSS|01C2]and she gave
[GNSS|01C3]also unto her husband
[GNSS|01C4]with her, and he did
[GNSS|01C5]eat.


[GNSS|01C6]3,7 And the eyes
[GNSS|01C7]of them both were opened,
[GNSS|01C8]and they knew that they
[GNSS|01C9]were naked;


[GNSS|01CA]and they sewed fig-leaves together,
[GNSS|01CB]and made themselves girdles.


[GNSS|01CC]3,8 And they heard
[GNSS|01CD]the voice of
[GNSS|01CE]the LORD God
[GNSS|01CF]walking in the garden toward
[GNSS|01D0]the cool of
[GNSS|01D1]the day;


[GNSS|01D2]and the man
[GNSS|01D3]and his wife hid themselves
[GNSS|01D4]from the presence
[GNSS|01D5]of the LORD God amongst
[GNSS|01D6]the trees of
[GNSS|01D7]the garden.


[GNSS|01D8]3,9 And the LORD God
[GNSS|01D9]called unto the man,
[GNSS|01DA]and said unto him: 'Where
[GNSS|01DB]art thou?' 3,10
[GNSS|01DC]And he said: 'I heard
[GNSS|01DD]Thy voice in
[GNSS|01DE]the garden, and I was
[GNSS|01DF]afraid, because I was naked;


[GNSS|01E0]and I hid myself.' 3,11
[GNSS|01E1]And He said: 'Who told
[GNSS|01E2]thee that thou wast naked?
[GNSS|01E3]Hast thou eaten
[GNSS|01E4]of the tree, whereof I
[GNSS|01E5]commanded thee that thou shouldest
[GNSS|01E6]not eat?' 3,12
[GNSS|01E7]And the man said: 'The
[GNSS|01E8]woman whom Thou gavest to
[GNSS|01E9]be with me, she gave
[GNSS|01EA]me of the tree,
[GNSS|01EB]and I did eat.' 3,13
[GNSS|01EC]And the LORD God
[GNSS|01ED]said unto the woman: 'What
[GNSS|01EE]is this thou hast done?'
[GNSS|01EF]And the woman said: 'The
[GNSS|01F0]serpent beguiled me,
[GNSS|01F1]and I did eat.' 3,14
[GNSS|01F2]And the LORD God
[GNSS|01F3]said unto the serpent: 'Because
[GNSS|01F4]thou hast done this,
[GNSS|01F5]cursed art thou from among
[GNSS|01F6]all cattle, and from among
[GNSS|01F7]all beasts of
[GNSS|01F8]the field;


[GNSS|01F9]upon thy belly shalt thou
[GNSS|01FA]go, and dust shalt thou
[GNSS|01FB]eat all the days
[GNSS|01FC]of thy life.


[GNSS|01FD]3,15 And I
[GNSS|01FE]will put enmity between thee
[GNSS|01FF]and the woman,
[GNSS|0200]and between thy seed
[GNSS|0201]and her seed;


[GNSS|0202]they shall bruise thy head,
[GNSS|0203]and thou shalt bruise their
[GNSS|0204]heel.' {S} 3,16 Unto
[GNSS|0205]the woman He said: 'I

[GNSS|0208]in pain thou shalt
[GNSS|0209]bring forth children;


[GNSS|020A]and thy desire shall be
[GNSS|020B]to thy husband,
[GNSS|020C]and he shall rule
[GNSS|020D]over thee.' {S} 3,17
[GNSS|020E]And unto Adam He said:
[GNSS|020F]'Because thou hast
[GNSS|0210]hearkened unto the voice
[GNSS|0211]of thy wife,
[GNSS|0212]and hast eaten
[GNSS|0213]of the tree,

[GNSS|0227]thou taken;


[GNSS|0228]for dust thou art,
[GNSS|0229]and unto dust shalt thou
[GNSS|022A]return.' 3,20 And
[GNSS|022B]the man called his wife's
[GNSS|022C]name Eve;


[GNSS|022D]because she was
[GNSS|022E]the mother of all living.


[GNSS|022F]3,21 And the LORD God
[GNSS|0230]made for Adam
[GNSS|0231]and for his wife garments

[GNSS|0233]clothed them.


[GNSS|0234]{P}  3,22
[GNSS|0235]And the LORD God said:

[GNSS|0239]and now, lest he put
[GNSS|023A]forth his hand,
[GNSS|023B]and take also
[GNSS|023C]of the tree

[GNSS|023F]Therefore the LORD God sent

[GNSS|0244]3,24 So He drove out
[GNSS|0245]the man;


[GNSS|0246]and He placed at
[GNSS|0247]the east of
[GNSS|0248]the garden of Eden
[GNSS|0249]the cherubim, and
[GNSS|024A]the flaming sword

[GNSS|024E]{S} 4,1 And

[GNSS|0253]and said: 'I
[GNSS|0254]have gotten a man
[GNSS|0255]with the help
[GNSS|0256]of the LORD.' 4,2
[GNSS|0257]And again she bore his
[GNSS|0258]brother Abel.


[GNSS|0259]And Abel was
[GNSS|025A]a keeper of sheep,
[GNSS|025B]but Cain was
[GNSS|025C]a tiller of
[GNSS|025D]the ground.


[GNSS|025E]4,3 And in process
[GNSS|025F]of time it came to
[GNSS|0260]pass, that Cain brought
[GNSS|0261]of the fruit
[GNSS|0262]of the ground an
[GNSS|0263]offering unto the LORD.


[GNSS|0264]4,4 And Abel, he
[GNSS|0265]also brought of
[GNSS|0266]the firstlings of his flock
[GNSS|0267]and of the fat thereof.


[GNSS|0268]And the LORD
[GNSS|0269]had respect unto Abel
[GNSS|026A]and to his offering;


[GNSS|026B]4,5 but unto Cain
[GNSS|026C]and to his
[GNSS|026D]offering He had
[GNSS|026E]not respect.


[GNSS|026F]And Cain was very wroth,
[GNSS|0270]and his countenance fell.


[GNSS|0271]4,6 And the LORD
[GNSS|0272]said unto Cain: 'Why art
[GNSS|0273]thou wroth? and
[GNSS|0274]why is thy countenance fallen?
[GNSS|0275]4,7 If thou doest well,
[GNSS|0276]shall it not be
[GNSS|0277]lifted up? and

[GNSS|027B]and unto thee is its
[GNSS|027C]desire, but thou mayest rule
[GNSS|027D]over it.' 4,8
[GNSS|027E]And Cain spoke unto Abel
[GNSS|027F]his brother.


[GNSS|0280]And it came to pass,
[GNSS|0281]when they were in
[GNSS|0282]the field, that Cain rose
[GNSS|0283]up against Abel his brother,
[GNSS|0284]and slew him.


[GNSS|0285]4,9 And the LORD
[GNSS|0286]said unto Cain: 'Where is
[GNSS|0287]Abel thy brother?'
[GNSS|0288]And he said: 'I know
[GNSS|0289]not;


[GNSS|028A]am I my brother's keeper?'
[GNSS|028B]4,10 And He said: 'What

[GNSS|028D]the voice of thy brother's
[GNSS|028E]blood crieth unto Me from
[GNSS|028F]the ground.


[GNSS|0290]4,11 And now
[GNSS|0291]cursed art thou from
[GNSS|0292]the ground, which hath
[GNSS|0293]opened her mouth to receive
[GNSS|0294]thy brother's blood from thy
[GNSS|0295]hand.


[GNSS|0296]4,12 When thou tillest
[GNSS|0297]the ground, it shall
[GNSS|0298]not henceforth yield unto thee
[GNSS|0299]her strength;


[GNSS|029A]a fugitive and
[GNSS|029B]a wanderer shalt thou be
[GNSS|029C]in the earth.' 4,13
[GNSS|029D]And Cain said unto
[GNSS|029E]the LORD: 'My punishment is
[GNSS|029F]greater than I
[GNSS|02A0]can bear.


[GNSS|02A1]4,14 Behold, Thou hast driven
[GNSS|02A2]me out this day from
[GNSS|02A3]the face of
[GNSS|02A4]the land;


[GNSS|02A5]and from Thy face shall
[GNSS|02A6]I be hid;

[GNSS|02A8]a fugitive and
[GNSS|02A9]a wanderer in

[GNSS|02AB]and it will come to
[GNSS|02AC]pass, that whosoever findeth me
[GNSS|02AD]will slay me.' 4,15
[GNSS|02AE]And the LORD
[GNSS|02AF]said unto him: 'Therefore whosoever
[GNSS|02B0]slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be
[GNSS|02B1]taken on him sevenfold.'
[GNSS|02B2]And the LORD set
[GNSS|02B3]a sign for Cain,
[GNSS|02B4]lest any finding him should
[GNSS|02B5]smite him.


[GNSS|02B6]4,16 And Cain
[GNSS|02B7]went out from
[GNSS|02B8]the presence of
[GNSS|02B9]the LORD, and dwelt in
[GNSS|02BA]the land of Nod, on
[GNSS|02BB]the east of Eden.


[GNSS|02BC]4,17 And Cain knew his
[GNSS|02BD]wife;


[GNSS|02BE]and she conceived,
[GNSS|02BF]and bore Enoch;


[GNSS|02C0]and he builded
[GNSS|02C1]a city, and
[GNSS|02C2]called the name
[GNSS|02C3]of the city
[GNSS|02C4]after the name
[GNSS|02C5]of his son Enoch.


[GNSS|02C6]4,18 And unto Enoch was
[GNSS|02C7]born Irad;

[GNSS|02CE]Adah, and the name
[GNSS|02CF]of the other Zillah.


[GNSS|02D0]4,20 And Adah bore Jabal;


[GNSS|02D1]he was the father
[GNSS|02D2]of such as dwell in
[GNSS|02D3]tents and have cattle.


[GNSS|02D4]4,21 And his brother's name
[GNSS|02D5]was Jubal;


[GNSS|02D6]he was the father
[GNSS|02D7]of all such
[GNSS|02D8]as handle the harp
[GNSS|02D9]and pipe.


[GNSS|02DA]4,22 And Zillah, she
[GNSS|02DB]also bore Tubal-cain,

[GNSS|02EC]avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy
[GNSS|02ED]and sevenfold.

[GNSS|03AE]of God came in unto
[GNSS|03AF]the daughters of men,
[GNSS|03B0]and they bore children to
[GNSS|03B1]them;


[GNSS|03B2]the same were
[GNSS|03B3]the mighty men that were
[GNSS|03B4]of old, the men
[GNSS|03B5]of renown.


[GNSS|03B6]{P}  6,5
[GNSS|03B7]And the LORD saw that
[GNSS|03B8]the wickedness of man was
[GNSS|03B9]great in the earth,
[GNSS|03BA]and that every imagination
[GNSS|03BB]of the thoughts
[GNSS|03BC]of his heart was
[GNSS|03BD]only evil continually.


[GNSS|03BE]6,6 And it
[GNSS|03BF]repented the LORD that He
[GNSS|03C0]had made man on
[GNSS|03C1]the earth, and it
[GNSS|03C2]grieved Him at His heart.


[GNSS|03C3]6,7 And the LORD said:
[GNSS|03C4]'I will blot out man
[GNSS|03C5]whom I have
[GNSS|03C6]created from the face
[GNSS|03C7]of the earth;


[GNSS|03C8]both man, and beast,
[GNSS|03C9]and creeping thing,
[GNSS|03CA]and fowl of
[GNSS|03CB]the air;


[GNSS|03CC]for it repenteth Me that
[GNSS|03CD]I have made them.' 6,8
[GNSS|03CE]But Noah found grace in
[GNSS|03CF]the eyes of
[GNSS|03D0]the LORD.


[GNSS|03D1]{P}  6,9
[GNSS|03D2]These are the generations
[GNSS|03D3]of Noah.


[GNSS|03D4]Noah was in his generations
[GNSS|03D5]a man righteous
[GNSS|03D6]and whole-hearted;


[GNSS|03D7]Noah walked with God.


[GNSS|03D8]6,10 And Noah begot three
[GNSS|03D9]sons, Shem, Ham,
[GNSS|03DA]and Japheth.


[GNSS|03DB]6,11 And the earth was
[GNSS|03DC]corrupt before God,
[GNSS|03DD]and the earth was
[GNSS|03DE]filled with violence.


[GNSS|03DF]6,12 And God saw
[GNSS|03E0]the earth, and, behold, it
[GNSS|03E1]was corrupt;


[GNSS|03E2]for all flesh
[GNSS|03E3]had corrupted their way upon
[GNSS|03E4]the earth.


[GNSS|03E5]{S} 6,13 And God
[GNSS|03E6]said unto Noah: 'The end
[GNSS|03E7]of all flesh is come
[GNSS|03E8]before Me; for
[GNSS|03E9]the earth is
[GNSS|03EA]filled with violence through them;


[GNSS|03EB]and, behold, I
[GNSS|03EC]will destroy them
[GNSS|03ED]with the earth.


[GNSS|03EE]6,14 Make thee an ark
[GNSS|03EF]of gopher wood;


[GNSS|03F0]with rooms shalt thou
[GNSS|03F1]make the ark,
[GNSS|03F2]and shalt pitch it within
[GNSS|03F3]and without with pitch.


[GNSS|03F4]6,15 And this is
[GNSS|03F5]how thou shalt
[GNSS|03F6]make it: the length
[GNSS|03F7]of the ark three
[GNSS|03F8]hundred cubits, the breadth
[GNSS|03F9]of it fifty cubits,
[GNSS|03FA]and the height
[GNSS|03FB]of it thirty cubits.


[GNSS|03FC]6,16 A light shalt thou
[GNSS|03FD]make to the ark,
[GNSS|03FE]and to a cubit shalt
[GNSS|03FF]thou finish it upward;


[GNSS|0400]and the door
[GNSS|0401]of the ark shalt thou
[GNSS|0402]set in the side thereof;


[GNSS|0403]with lower, second,
[GNSS|0404]and third stories shalt thou
[GNSS|0405]make it. 6,17
[GNSS|0406]And I, behold, I
[GNSS|0407]do bring the flood
[GNSS|0408]of waters upon
[GNSS|0409]the earth, to destroy all
[GNSS|040A]flesh, wherein is
[GNSS|040B]the breath of life, from
[GNSS|040C]under heaven;


[GNSS|040D]every thing that is in
[GNSS|040E]the earth shall perish.


[GNSS|040F]6,18 But I
[GNSS|0410]will establish My covenant
[GNSS|0411]with thee;


[GNSS|0412]and thou shalt come into
[GNSS|0413]the ark, thou,
[GNSS|0414]and thy sons,
[GNSS|0415]and thy wife,
[GNSS|0416]and thy sons' wives
[GNSS|0417]with thee.


[GNSS|0418]6,19 And of every
[GNSS|0419]living thing of all flesh,
[GNSS|041A]two of every sort shalt
[GNSS|041B]thou bring into
[GNSS|041C]the ark, to keep them
[GNSS|041D]alive with thee;


[GNSS|041E]they shall be male
[GNSS|041F]and female.


[GNSS|0420]6,20 Of the fowl
[GNSS|0421]after their kind,
[GNSS|0422]and of the cattle
[GNSS|0423]after their kind,
[GNSS|0424]of every creeping
[GNSS|0425]thing of the ground
[GNSS|0426]after its kind, two
[GNSS|0427]of every sort shall come
[GNSS|0428]unto thee, to keep them
[GNSS|0429]alive.


[GNSS|042A]6,21 And take thou unto
[GNSS|042B]thee of all food that
[GNSS|042C]is eaten, and gather it
[GNSS|042D]to thee;


[GNSS|042E]and it shall be
[GNSS|042F]for food for thee,
[GNSS|0430]and for them.' 6,22
[GNSS|0431]Thus did Noah;


[GNSS|0432]according to all that God
[GNSS|0433]commanded him, so did he.
[GNSS|0434]7,1 And the LORD
[GNSS|0435]said unto Noah: 'Come thou
[GNSS|0436]and all thy house into
[GNSS|0437]the ark;


[GNSS|0438]for thee have I seen
[GNSS|0439]righteous before Me in this
[GNSS|043A]generation.


[GNSS|043B]7,2 Of every clean beast
[GNSS|043C]thou shalt take to thee
[GNSS|043D]seven and seven, each
[GNSS|043E]with his mate;


[GNSS|043F]and of the beasts that
[GNSS|0440]are not clean two [and
[GNSS|0441]two], each with his mate;


[GNSS|0442]7,3 of the fowl
[GNSS|0443]also of the air, seven
[GNSS|0444]and seven, male
[GNSS|0445]and female;


[GNSS|0446]to keep seed alive upon
[GNSS|0447]the face of all
[GNSS|0448]the earth.


[GNSS|0449]7,4 For yet seven days,
[GNSS|044A]and I will cause it
[GNSS|044B]to rain upon
[GNSS|044C]the earth forty days
[GNSS|044D]and forty nights;


[GNSS|044E]and every living substance that
[GNSS|044F]I have made
[GNSS|0450]will I blot out from
[GNSS|0451]off the face
[GNSS|0452]of the earth.' 7,5
[GNSS|0453]And Noah did
[GNSS|0454]according unto all that
[GNSS|0455]the LORD commanded him.


[GNSS|0456]7,6 And Noah was six
[GNSS|0457]hundred years old
[GNSS|0458]when the flood
[GNSS|0459]of waters was upon
[GNSS|045A]the earth.


[GNSS|045B]7,7 And Noah
[GNSS|045C]went in, and his sons,
[GNSS|045D]and his wife,
[GNSS|045E]and his sons' wives
[GNSS|045F]with him, into
[GNSS|0460]the ark, because
[GNSS|0461]of the waters
[GNSS|0462]of the flood.


[GNSS|0463]7,8 Of clean beasts,
[GNSS|0464]and of beasts that are
[GNSS|0465]not clean, and
[GNSS|0466]of fowls, and
[GNSS|0467]of every thing that creepeth
[GNSS|0468]upon the ground, 7,9 there
[GNSS|0469]went in two
[GNSS|046A]and two unto Noah into
[GNSS|046B]the ark, male
[GNSS|046C]and female, as God
[GNSS|046D]commanded Noah.


[GNSS|046E]7,10 And it came to
[GNSS|046F]pass after the seven days,
[GNSS|0470]that the waters
[GNSS|0471]of the flood were upon
[GNSS|0472]the earth.


[GNSS|0473]7,11 In the six hundredth
[GNSS|0474]year of Noah's life, in
[GNSS|0475]the second month, on
[GNSS|0476]the seventeenth day
[GNSS|0477]of the month, on
[GNSS|0478]the same day were all
[GNSS|0479]the fountains of
[GNSS|047A]the great deep broken up,
[GNSS|047B]and the windows
[GNSS|047C]of heaven were opened.


[GNSS|047D]7,12 And the rain was
[GNSS|047E]upon the earth forty days
[GNSS|047F]and forty nights.


[GNSS|0480]7,13 In the selfsame day
[GNSS|0481]entered Noah, and Shem,
[GNSS|0482]and Ham, and Japheth,
[GNSS|0483]the sons of Noah,
[GNSS|0484]and Noah's wife,
[GNSS|0485]and the three wives
[GNSS|0486]of his sons
[GNSS|0487]with them, into
[GNSS|0488]the ark;


[GNSS|0489]7,14 they, and every beast
[GNSS|048A]after its kind,
[GNSS|048B]and all the cattle
[GNSS|048C]after their kind,
[GNSS|048D]and every creeping
[GNSS|048E]thing that creepeth upon
[GNSS|048F]the earth after its kind,
[GNSS|0490]and every fowl
[GNSS|0491]after its kind, every bird
[GNSS|0492]of every sort.


[GNSS|0493]7,15 And they
[GNSS|0494]went in unto Noah into
[GNSS|0495]the ark, two
[GNSS|0496]and two of all flesh
[GNSS|0497]wherein is the breath
[GNSS|0498]of life.


[GNSS|0499]7,16 And they that
[GNSS|049A]went in, went in male
[GNSS|049B]and female of all flesh,
[GNSS|049C]as God commanded him;


[GNSS|049D]and the LORD shut him
[GNSS|049E]in. 7,17 And
[GNSS|049F]the flood was forty days
[GNSS|04A0]upon the earth;


[GNSS|04A1]and the waters increased,
[GNSS|04A2]and bore up
[GNSS|04A3]the ark, and it was
[GNSS|04A4]lifted up above
[GNSS|04A5]the earth.


[GNSS|04A6]7,18 And the waters prevailed,
[GNSS|04A7]and increased greatly upon
[GNSS|04A8]the earth;


[GNSS|04A9]and the ark
[GNSS|04AA]went upon the face
[GNSS|04AB]of the waters.


[GNSS|04AC]7,19 And the waters
[GNSS|04AD]prevailed exceedingly upon
[GNSS|04AE]the earth;


[GNSS|04AF]and all the high mountains
[GNSS|04B0]that were under
[GNSS|04B1]the whole heaven were covered.


[GNSS|04B2]7,20 Fifteen cubits upward did
[GNSS|04B3]the waters prevail;


[GNSS|04B4]and the mountains were covered.


[GNSS|04B5]7,21 And all flesh
[GNSS|04B6]perished that moved upon
[GNSS|04B7]the earth, both fowl,
[GNSS|04B8]and cattle, and beast,
[GNSS|04B9]and every swarming
[GNSS|04BA]thing that swarmeth upon
[GNSS|04BB]the earth, and every man;


[GNSS|04BC]7,22 all in
[GNSS|04BD]whose nostrils was
[GNSS|04BE]the breath of
[GNSS|04BF]the spirit of life, whatsoever
[GNSS|04C0]was in the dry land,
[GNSS|04C1]died.


[GNSS|04C2]7,23 And He
[GNSS|04C3]blotted out every
[GNSS|04C4]living substance which was upon
[GNSS|04C5]the face of
[GNSS|04C6]the ground, both man,
[GNSS|04C7]and cattle, and
[GNSS|04C8]creeping thing, and fowl
[GNSS|04C9]of the heaven;


[GNSS|04CA]and they were
[GNSS|04CB]blotted out from
[GNSS|04CC]the earth;


[GNSS|04CD]and Noah only was left,
[GNSS|04CE]and they that were
[GNSS|04CF]with him in
[GNSS|04D0]the ark.


[GNSS|04D1]7,24 And the waters
[GNSS|04D2]prevailed upon the earth
[GNSS|04D3]a hundred and fifty days.


[GNSS|04D4]8,1 And God
[GNSS|04D5]remembered Noah, and every
[GNSS|04D6]living thing, and all
[GNSS|04D7]the cattle that were
[GNSS|04D8]with him in
[GNSS|04D9]the ark;


[GNSS|04DA]and God made
[GNSS|04DB]a wind to pass
[GNSS|04DC]over the earth,
[GNSS|04DD]and the waters assuaged;


[GNSS|04DE]8,2 the fountains
[GNSS|04DF]also of the deep
[GNSS|04E0]and the windows
[GNSS|04E1]of heaven were stopped,
[GNSS|04E2]and the rain from heaven
[GNSS|04E3]was restrained.


[GNSS|04E4]8,3 And the waters
[GNSS|04E5]returned from off
[GNSS|04E6]the earth continually;


[GNSS|04E7]and after the end
[GNSS|04E8]of a hundred
[GNSS|04E9]and fifty days
[GNSS|04EA]the waters decreased.


[GNSS|04EB]8,4 And the ark
[GNSS|04EC]rested in the seventh month,
[GNSS|04ED]on the seventeenth day
[GNSS|04EE]of the month, upon
[GNSS|04EF]the mountains of Ararat.


[GNSS|04F0]8,5 And the waters
[GNSS|04F1]decreased continually until
[GNSS|04F2]the tenth month;


[GNSS|04F3]in the tenth month, on
[GNSS|04F4]the first day
[GNSS|04F5]of the month, were
[GNSS|04F6]the tops of
[GNSS|04F7]the mountains seen.


[GNSS|04F8]8,6 And it came to
[GNSS|04F9]pass at the end
[GNSS|04FA]of forty days, that Noah
[GNSS|04FB]opened the window
[GNSS|04FC]of the ark
[GNSS|04FD]which he had made.


[GNSS|04FE]8,7 And he sent forth
[GNSS|04FF]a raven, and it
[GNSS|0500]went forth to
[GNSS|0501]and fro, until
[GNSS|0502]the waters were
[GNSS|0503]dried up from off
[GNSS|0504]the earth.


[GNSS|0505]8,8 And he sent forth
[GNSS|0506]a dove from him, to
[GNSS|0507]see if the waters were
[GNSS|0508]abated from off
[GNSS|0509]the face of
[GNSS|050A]the ground.


[GNSS|050B]8,9 But the dove found
[GNSS|050C]no rest for
[GNSS|050D]the sole of her foot,
[GNSS|050E]and she returned unto him
[GNSS|050F]to the ark,
[GNSS|0510]for the waters were on
[GNSS|0511]the face of
[GNSS|0512]the whole earth;


[GNSS|0513]and he put forth his
[GNSS|0514]hand, and took her,
[GNSS|0515]and brought her in unto
[GNSS|0516]him into the ark.


[GNSS|0517]8,10 And he
[GNSS|0518]stayed yet other seven days;


[GNSS|0519]and again he sent forth
[GNSS|051A]the dove out
[GNSS|051B]of the ark.


[GNSS|051C]8,11 And the dove came
[GNSS|051D]in to him at eventide;


[GNSS|051E]and lo in her mouth
[GNSS|051F]an olive-leaf freshly plucked;


[GNSS|0520]so Noah knew that
[GNSS|0521]the waters were
[GNSS|0522]abated from off
[GNSS|0523]the earth.


[GNSS|0524]8,12 And he
[GNSS|0525]stayed yet other seven days;


[GNSS|0526]and sent forth
[GNSS|0527]the dove;


[GNSS|0528]and she returned
[GNSS|0529]not again unto him any
[GNSS|052A]more.


[GNSS|052B]8,13 And it came to
[GNSS|052C]pass in the six
[GNSS|052D]hundred and first year, in
[GNSS|052E]the first month,
[GNSS|052F]the first day
[GNSS|0530]of the month,
[GNSS|0531]the waters were
[GNSS|0532]dried up from off
[GNSS|0533]the earth;


[GNSS|0534]and Noah removed
[GNSS|0535]the covering of
[GNSS|0536]the ark, and looked,
[GNSS|0537]and behold, the face
[GNSS|0538]of the ground was dried.


[GNSS|0539]8,14 And in
[GNSS|053A]the second month, on
[GNSS|053B]the seven and twentieth day
[GNSS|053C]of the month, was
[GNSS|053D]the earth dry.


[GNSS|053E]{S} 8,15 And God spoke
[GNSS|053F]unto Noah, saying: 8,16 'Go
[GNSS|0540]forth from the ark, thou,
[GNSS|0541]and thy wife,
[GNSS|0542]and thy sons,
[GNSS|0543]and thy sons' wives
[GNSS|0544]with thee.


[GNSS|0545]8,17 Bring forth
[GNSS|0546]with thee every
[GNSS|0547]living thing that is
[GNSS|0548]with thee of all flesh,
[GNSS|0549]both fowl, and cattle,
[GNSS|054A]and every creeping
[GNSS|054B]thing that creepeth upon
[GNSS|054C]the earth;


[GNSS|054D]that they may swarm in
[GNSS|054E]the earth, and be fruitful,
[GNSS|054F]and multiply upon
[GNSS|0550]the earth.' 8,18
[GNSS|0551]And Noah went forth,
[GNSS|0552]and his sons,
[GNSS|0553]and his wife,
[GNSS|0554]and his sons' wives
[GNSS|0555]with him;


[GNSS|0556]8,19 every beast, every
[GNSS|0557]creeping thing, and every fowl,
[GNSS|0558]whatsoever moveth upon
[GNSS|0559]the earth, after their families;


[GNSS|055A]went forth out
[GNSS|055B]of the ark.


[GNSS|055C]8,20 And Noah
[GNSS|055D]builded an altar unto
[GNSS|055E]the LORD;


[GNSS|055F]and took of every clean
[GNSS|0560]beast, and of every clean
[GNSS|0561]fowl, and offered burnt-offerings on
[GNSS|0562]the altar.


[GNSS|0563]8,21 And the LORD
[GNSS|0564]smelled the sweet savour;


[GNSS|0565]and the LORD
[GNSS|0566]said in His heart: 'I
[GNSS|0567]will not again curse
[GNSS|0568]the ground any
[GNSS|0569]more for man's sake;


[GNSS|056A]for the imagination
[GNSS|056B]of man's heart is evil
[GNSS|056C]from his youth;


[GNSS|056D]neither will I
[GNSS|056E]again smite any
[GNSS|056F]more every thing living,
[GNSS|0570]as I have done.


[GNSS|0571]8,22 While the earth remaineth,
[GNSS|0572]seedtime and harvest,
[GNSS|0573]and cold and heat,
[GNSS|0574]and summer and winter,
[GNSS|0575]and day and night shall
[GNSS|0576]not cease.' 9,1
[GNSS|0577]And God blessed Noah
[GNSS|0578]and his sons,
[GNSS|0579]and said unto them: 'Be
[GNSS|057A]fruitful and multiply,
[GNSS|057B]and replenish the earth.


[GNSS|057C]9,2 And the fear
[GNSS|057D]of you and
[GNSS|057E]the dread of you shall

[GNSS|0580]of the earth,
[GNSS|0581]and upon every fowl
[GNSS|0582]of the air,
[GNSS|0583]and upon all wherewith
[GNSS|0584]the ground teemeth,
[GNSS|0585]and upon all
[GNSS|0586]the fishes of
[GNSS|0587]the sea: into your hand
[GNSS|0588]are they delivered.


[GNSS|0589]9,3 Every moving
[GNSS|058A]thing that liveth shall be
[GNSS|058B]for food for you;


[GNSS|058C]as the green herb
[GNSS|058D]have I given you all.


[GNSS|058E]9,4 Only flesh
[GNSS|058F]with the life thereof,
[GNSS|0590]which is the blood thereof,
[GNSS|0591]shall ye not eat.


[GNSS|0592]9,5 And surely your blood
[GNSS|0593]of your lives
[GNSS|0594]will I require;


[GNSS|0595]at the hand
[GNSS|0596]of every beast
[GNSS|0597]will I require it;
[GNSS|0598]and at the hand
[GNSS|0599]of man, even at
[GNSS|059A]the hand of every man's
[GNSS|059B]brother, will I require
[GNSS|059C]the life of man.


[GNSS|059D]9,6 Whoso sheddeth man's blood,
[GNSS|059E]by man shall his blood
[GNSS|059F]be shed;


[GNSS|05A0]for in the image
[GNSS|05A1]of God made He man.


[GNSS|05A2]9,7 And you, be ye
[GNSS|05A3]fruitful, and multiply;


[GNSS|05A4]swarm in the earth,
[GNSS|05A5]and multiply therein.' {S} 9,8
[GNSS|05A6]And God spoke unto Noah,
[GNSS|05A7]and to his sons
[GNSS|05A8]with him, saying: 9,9 'As
[GNSS|05A9]for Me, behold, I establish
[GNSS|05AA]My covenant with you,
[GNSS|05AB]and with your seed
[GNSS|05AC]after you;


[GNSS|05AD]9,10 and with every
[GNSS|05AE]living creature that is
[GNSS|05AF]with you, the fowl,
[GNSS|05B0]the cattle, and every beast
[GNSS|05B1]of the earth
[GNSS|05B2]with you;


[GNSS|05B3]of all that
[GNSS|05B4]go out of
[GNSS|05B5]the ark, even every beast
[GNSS|05B6]of the earth.


[GNSS|05B7]9,11 And I
[GNSS|05B8]will establish My covenant
[GNSS|05B9]with you;


[GNSS|05BA]neither shall all flesh be
[GNSS|05BB]cut off any
[GNSS|05BC]more by the waters
[GNSS|05BD]of the flood;


[GNSS|05BE]neither shall there any
[GNSS|05BF]more be a flood to
[GNSS|05C0]destroy the earth.' 9,12
[GNSS|05C1]And God said: 'This is
[GNSS|05C2]the token of
[GNSS|05C3]the covenant which I
[GNSS|05C4]make between Me
[GNSS|05C5]and you and every
[GNSS|05C6]living creature that is
[GNSS|05C7]with you, for perpetual generations:
[GNSS|05C8]9,13 I have set My
[GNSS|05C9]bow in the cloud,
[GNSS|05CA]and it shall be
[GNSS|05CB]for a token
[GNSS|05CC]of a covenant between Me
[GNSS|05CD]and the earth.


[GNSS|05CE]9,14 And it shall come
[GNSS|05CF]to pass, when I
[GNSS|05D0]bring clouds over
[GNSS|05D1]the earth, and
[GNSS|05D2]the bow is seen in
[GNSS|05D3]the cloud, 9,15 that I
[GNSS|05D4]will remember My covenant,
[GNSS|05D5]which is between Me
[GNSS|05D6]and you and every
[GNSS|05D7]living creature of all flesh;


[GNSS|05D8]and the waters shall
[GNSS|05D9]no more become
[GNSS|05DA]a flood to destroy all
[GNSS|05DB]flesh.


[GNSS|05DC]9,16 And the bow shall
[GNSS|05DD]be in the cloud;


[GNSS|05DE]and I will look upon
[GNSS|05DF]it, that I may remember
[GNSS|05E0]the everlasting covenant between God
[GNSS|05E1]and every living creature
[GNSS|05E2]of all flesh that is
[GNSS|05E3]upon the earth.' 9,17
[GNSS|05E4]And God said unto Noah:
[GNSS|05E5]'This is the token
[GNSS|05E6]of the covenant
[GNSS|05E7]which I have
[GNSS|05E8]established between Me
[GNSS|05E9]and all flesh that is
[GNSS|05EA]upon the earth.' {P} 
[GNSS|05EB]9,18 And the sons
[GNSS|05EC]of Noah, that
[GNSS|05ED]went forth from
[GNSS|05EE]the ark, were Shem,
[GNSS|05EF]and Ham, and Japheth;


[GNSS|05F0]and Ham is
[GNSS|05F1]the father of Canaan.


[GNSS|05F2]9,19 These three were
[GNSS|05F3]the sons of Noah,
[GNSS|05F4]and of these was
[GNSS|05F5]the whole earth overspread.


[GNSS|05F6]9,20 And Noah
[GNSS|05F7]the husbandman began,
[GNSS|05F8]and planted a vineyard.


[GNSS|05F9]9,21 And he drank
[GNSS|05FA]of the wine,
[GNSS|05FB]and was drunken;


[GNSS|05FC]and he was
[GNSS|05FD]uncovered within his tent.


[GNSS|05FE]9,22 And Ham,
[GNSS|05FF]the father of Canaan, saw
[GNSS|0600]the nakedness of his father,
[GNSS|0601]and told his two brethren
[GNSS|0602]without.


[GNSS|0603]9,23 And Shem
[GNSS|0604]and Japheth took
[GNSS|0605]a garment, and laid it
[GNSS|0606]upon both their shoulders,
[GNSS|0607]and went backward,
[GNSS|0608]and covered the nakedness
[GNSS|0609]of their father;


[GNSS|060A]and their faces were backward,
[GNSS|060B]and they saw
[GNSS|060C]not their father's nakedness.


[GNSS|060D]9,24 And Noah awoke from
[GNSS|060E]his wine, and knew
[GNSS|060F]what his youngest son
[GNSS|0610]had done unto him.


[GNSS|0611]9,25 And he said:
[GNSS|0612]Cursed be Canaan;


[GNSS|0613]a servant of servants shall
[GNSS|0614]he be unto his brethren.


[GNSS|0615]9,26 And he said:
[GNSS|0616]Blessed be the LORD,
[GNSS|0617]the God of Shem;


[GNSS|0618]and let Canaan be their
[GNSS|0619]servant.


[GNSS|061A]9,27 God enlarge Japheth,
[GNSS|061B]and he shall dwell in
[GNSS|061C]the tents of Shem;


[GNSS|061D]and let Canaan be their
[GNSS|061E]servant.


[GNSS|061F]9,28 And Noah
[GNSS|0620]lived after the flood three
[GNSS|0621]hundred and fifty years.


[GNSS|0622]9,29 And all
[GNSS|0623]the days of Noah were
[GNSS|0624]nine hundred and fifty years;


[GNSS|0625]and he died.


[GNSS|0626]{P}  10,1
[GNSS|0627]Now these are

[GNSS|0629]the sons of Noah: Shem,

[GNSS|062C]born after the flood.


[GNSS|062D]10,2 The sons

[GNSS|0637]and Tarshish, Kittim,
[GNSS|0638]and Dodanim.


[GNSS|0639]10,5 Of these were
[GNSS|063A]the isles of
[GNSS|063B]the nations divided in their
[GNSS|063C]lands, every one
[GNSS|063D]after his tongue,
[GNSS|063E]after their families, in their
[GNSS|063F]nations.


[GNSS|0640]10,6 And the sons
[GNSS|0641]of Ham: Cush,
[GNSS|0642]and Mizraim, and Put,
[GNSS|0643]and Canaan.


[GNSS|0644]10,7 And the sons
[GNSS|0645]of Cush: Seba,
[GNSS|0646]and Havilah, and Sabtah,
[GNSS|0647]and Raamah, and Sabteca;


[GNSS|0648]and the sons
[GNSS|0649]of Raamah: Sheba,
[GNSS|064A]and Dedan.


[GNSS|064B]10,8 And Cush begot Nimrod;


[GNSS|064C]he began to be
[GNSS|064D]a mighty one in
[GNSS|064E]the earth.


[GNSS|064F]10,9 He was
[GNSS|0650]a mighty hunter
[GNSS|0651]before the LORD;


[GNSS|0652]wherefore it is said: 'Like
[GNSS|0653]Nimrod a mighty hunter
[GNSS|0654]before the LORD.' 10,10
[GNSS|0655]And the beginning
[GNSS|0656]of his kingdom was Babel,
[GNSS|0657]and Erech, and Accad,
[GNSS|0658]and Calneh, in
[GNSS|0659]the land of Shinar.


[GNSS|065A]10,11 Out of that land
[GNSS|065B]went forth Asshur,
[GNSS|065C]and builded Nineveh,
[GNSS|065D]and Rehoboth-ir, and Calah, 10,12
[GNSS|065E]and Resen between Nineveh
[GNSS|065F]and Calah-the same is
[GNSS|0660]the great city.


[GNSS|0661]10,13 And Mizraim begot Ludim,
[GNSS|0662]and Anamim, and Lehabim,

[GNSS|0673]the families of
[GNSS|0674]the Canaanite spread abroad.


[GNSS|0675]10,19 And the border
[GNSS|0676]of the Canaanite was from
[GNSS|0677]Zidon, as thou goest toward
[GNSS|0678]Gerar, unto Gaza;


[GNSS|0679]as thou goest toward Sodom
[GNSS|067A]and Gomorrah and Admah
[GNSS|067B]and Zeboiim, unto Lasha.


[GNSS|067C]10,20 These are

[GNSS|0686]also were children born.


[GNSS|0687]10,22 The sons
[GNSS|0688]of Shem: Elam,

[GNSS|0690]and Shelah begot Eber.


[GNSS|0691]10,25 And unto Eber were
[GNSS|0692]born two sons;


[GNSS|0693]the name of
[GNSS|0694]the one was Peleg;


[GNSS|0695]for in his days was
[GNSS|0696]the earth divided;


[GNSS|0697]and his brother's name was
[GNSS|0698]Joktan.


[GNSS|0699]10,26 And Joktan begot Almodad,
[GNSS|069A]and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth,
[GNSS|069B]and Jerah;


[GNSS|069C]10,27 and Hadoram,

[GNSS|06A2]all these were
[GNSS|06A3]the sons of Joktan.


[GNSS|06A4]10,30 And their
[GNSS|06A5]dwelling was from Mesha,
[GNSS|06A6]as thou goest toward Sephar,
[GNSS|06A7]unto the mountain
[GNSS|06A8]of the east.


[GNSS|06A9]10,31 These are
[GNSS|06AA]the sons of Shem,
[GNSS|06AB]after their families,
[GNSS|06AC]after their tongues, in their
[GNSS|06AD]lands, after their nations.


[GNSS|06AE]10,32 These are
[GNSS|06AF]the families of
[GNSS|06B0]the sons of Noah,
[GNSS|06B1]after their generations, in their
[GNSS|06B2]nations;


[GNSS|06B3]and of these were
[GNSS|06B4]the nations divided in
[GNSS|06B5]the earth after
[GNSS|06B6]the flood.


[GNSS|06B7]{P}  11,1
[GNSS|06B8]And the whole earth was
[GNSS|06B9]of one language
[GNSS|06BA]and of one speech.


[GNSS|06BB]11,2 And it came to
[GNSS|06BC]pass, as they
[GNSS|06BD]journeyed east, that they found
[GNSS|06BE]a plain in
[GNSS|06BF]the land of Shinar;


[GNSS|06C0]and they dwelt there.


[GNSS|06C1]11,3 And they
[GNSS|06C2]said one to another: 'Come,
[GNSS|06C3]let us make brick,
[GNSS|06C4]and burn them thoroughly.'
[GNSS|06C5]And they had brick
[GNSS|06C6]for stone, and slime
[GNSS|06C7]had they for mortar.


[GNSS|06C8]11,4 And they said: 'Come,
[GNSS|06C9]let us build us
[GNSS|06CA]a city, and
[GNSS|06CB]a tower, with its top
[GNSS|06CC]in heaven, and let us
[GNSS|06CD]make us a name;


[GNSS|06CE]lest we be
[GNSS|06CF]scattered abroad upon
[GNSS|06D0]the face of
[GNSS|06D1]the whole earth.' 11,5
[GNSS|06D2]And the LORD came down
[GNSS|06D3]to see the city
[GNSS|06D4]and the tower,
[GNSS|06D5]which the children
[GNSS|06D6]of men builded.


[GNSS|06D7]11,6 And the LORD said:
[GNSS|06D8]'Behold, they are one people,
[GNSS|06D9]and they have all one
[GNSS|06DA]language;


[GNSS|06DB]and this is
[GNSS|06DC]what they begin to do;
[GNSS|06DD]and now nothing
[GNSS|06DE]will be withholden from them,
[GNSS|06DF]which they purpose to do.
[GNSS|06E0]11,7 Come, let us
[GNSS|06E1]go down, and there confound
[GNSS|06E2]their language, that they may
[GNSS|06E3]not understand one another's speech.'
[GNSS|06E4]11,8 So the LORD
[GNSS|06E5]scattered them abroad from thence
[GNSS|06E6]upon the face
[GNSS|06E7]of all the earth;


[GNSS|06E8]and they left off to
[GNSS|06E9]build the city.


[GNSS|06EA]11,9 Therefore was
[GNSS|06EB]the name of it
[GNSS|06EC]called Babel;


[GNSS|06ED]because the LORD did there
[GNSS|06EE]confound the language
[GNSS|06EF]of all the earth;


[GNSS|06F0]and from thence did
[GNSS|06F1]the LORD scatter them abroad

[GNSS|0749]was Sarai;


[GNSS|074A]and the name
[GNSS|074B]of Nahor's wife, Milcah,
[GNSS|074C]the daughter of Haran,
[GNSS|074D]the father of Milcah,
[GNSS|074E]and the father
[GNSS|074F]of Iscah.


[GNSS|0750]11,30 And Sarai was barren;


[GNSS|0751]she had no child.


[GNSS|0752]11,31 And Terah took Abram
[GNSS|0753]his son, and Lot
[GNSS|0754]the son of Haran, his
[GNSS|0755]son's son, and Sarai his
[GNSS|0756]daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife;


[GNSS|0757]and they went forth
[GNSS|0758]with them from Ur
[GNSS|0759]of the Chaldees, to
[GNSS|075A]go into the land
[GNSS|075B]of Canaan;


[GNSS|075C]and they came unto Haran,
[GNSS|075D]and dwelt there.


[GNSS|075E]11,32 And the days
[GNSS|075F]of Terah were two
[GNSS|0760]hundred and five years;


[GNSS|0761]and Terah died in Haran.


[GNSS|0762]{P}  12,1
[GNSS|0763]Now the LORD
[GNSS|0764]said unto Abram: 'Get thee
[GNSS|0765]out of thy country,
[GNSS|0766]and from thy kindred,
[GNSS|0767]and from thy father's house,
[GNSS|0768]unto the land that I
[GNSS|0769]will show thee.


[GNSS|076A]12,2 And I
[GNSS|076B]will make of thee
[GNSS|076C]a great nation,
[GNSS|076D]and I will bless thee,
[GNSS|076E]and make thy name great;


[GNSS|076F]and be thou
[GNSS|0770]a blessing.


[GNSS|0771]12,3 And I
[GNSS|0772]will bless them that bless
[GNSS|0773]thee, and him that curseth
[GNSS|0774]thee will I curse;


[GNSS|0775]and in thee shall all
[GNSS|0776]the families of
[GNSS|0777]the earth be blessed.' 12,4
[GNSS|0778]So Abram went,
[GNSS|0779]as the LORD
[GNSS|077A]had spoken unto him;


[GNSS|077B]and Lot went
[GNSS|077C]with him;


[GNSS|077D]and Abram was seventy
[GNSS|077E]and five years old
[GNSS|077F]when he departed out
[GNSS|0780]of Haran.


[GNSS|0781]12,5 And Abram took Sarai
[GNSS|0782]his wife, and Lot his
[GNSS|0783]brother's son, and all their
[GNSS|0784]substance that they
[GNSS|0785]had gathered, and
[GNSS|0786]the souls that they
[GNSS|0787]had gotten in Haran;


[GNSS|0788]and they went forth to
[GNSS|0789]go into the land
[GNSS|078A]of Canaan;


[GNSS|078B]and into the land
[GNSS|078C]of Canaan they came.


[GNSS|078D]12,6 And Abram
[GNSS|078E]passed through the land unto
[GNSS|078F]the place of Shechem, unto
[GNSS|0790]the terebinth of Moreh.


[GNSS|0791]And the Canaanite was
[GNSS|0792]then in the land.


[GNSS|0793]12,7 And the LORD
[GNSS|0794]appeared unto Abram,
[GNSS|0795]and said: 'Unto thy seed
[GNSS|0796]will I give this land';


[GNSS|0797]and he builded there an
[GNSS|0798]altar unto the LORD,
[GNSS|0799]who appeared unto him.


[GNSS|079A]12,8 And he
[GNSS|079B]removed from thence unto
[GNSS|079C]the mountain on
[GNSS|079D]the east of Beth-el,
[GNSS|079E]and pitched his tent,
[GNSS|079F]having Beth-el on
[GNSS|07A0]the west, and Ai on
[GNSS|07A1]the east;


[GNSS|07A2]and he builded there an
[GNSS|07A3]altar unto the LORD,
[GNSS|07A4]and called upon
[GNSS|07A5]the name of
[GNSS|07A6]the LORD.


[GNSS|07A7]12,9 And Abram journeyed,
[GNSS|07A8]going on still toward
[GNSS|07A9]the South.


[GNSS|07AA]{P}  12,10
[GNSS|07AB]And there was
[GNSS|07AC]a famine in
[GNSS|07AD]the land;


[GNSS|07AE]and Abram went down into
[GNSS|07AF]Egypt to sojourn there;


[GNSS|07B0]for the famine was sore
[GNSS|07B1]in the land.


[GNSS|07B2]12,11 And it came to
[GNSS|07B3]pass, when he was come
[GNSS|07B4]near to enter into Egypt,
[GNSS|07B5]that he said unto Sarai
[GNSS|07B6]his wife: 'Behold now, I
[GNSS|07B7]know that thou art
[GNSS|07B8]a fair woman to look
[GNSS|07B9]upon.


[GNSS|07BA]12,12 And it
[GNSS|07BB]will come to pass,
[GNSS|07BC]when the Egyptians shall see
[GNSS|07BD]thee, that they
[GNSS|07BE]will say: This is his
[GNSS|07BF]wife;


[GNSS|07C0]and they will kill me,
[GNSS|07C1]but thee they
[GNSS|07C2]will keep alive.


[GNSS|07C3]12,13 Say, I pray thee,
[GNSS|07C4]thou art my sister;


[GNSS|07C5]that it may be well
[GNSS|07C6]with me for thy sake,
[GNSS|07C7]and that my soul may
[GNSS|07C8]live because of thee.' 12,14
[GNSS|07C9]And it came to pass,
[GNSS|07CA]that, when Abram was come
[GNSS|07CB]into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld
[GNSS|07CC]the woman that she was
[GNSS|07CD]very fair.


[GNSS|07CE]12,15 And the princes
[GNSS|07CF]of Pharaoh saw her,
[GNSS|07D0]and praised her to Pharaoh;


[GNSS|07D1]and the woman was taken
[GNSS|07D2]into Pharaoh's house.


[GNSS|07D3]12,16 And he dealt well
[GNSS|07D4]with Abram for her sake;


[GNSS|07D5]and he had sheep,
[GNSS|07D6]and oxen, and he-asses,
[GNSS|07D7]and men-servants, and maid-servants,
[GNSS|07D8]and she-asses, and camels.


[GNSS|07D9]12,17 And the LORD
[GNSS|07DA]plagued Pharaoh and his house
[GNSS|07DB]with great plagues
[GNSS|07DC]because of Sarai Abram's wife.


[GNSS|07DD]12,18 And Pharaoh
[GNSS|07DE]called Abram, and said: 'What
[GNSS|07DF]is this that thou hast
[GNSS|07E0]done unto me?
[GNSS|07E1]why didst thou
[GNSS|07E2]not tell me that she
[GNSS|07E3]was thy wife? 12,19
[GNSS|07E4]Why saidst thou: She is
[GNSS|07E5]my sister? so that I
[GNSS|07E6]took her to be my
[GNSS|07E7]wife;


[GNSS|07E8]now therefore behold thy wife,
[GNSS|07E9]take her, and
[GNSS|07EA]go thy way.' 12,20
[GNSS|07EB]And Pharaoh gave men charge
[GNSS|07EC]concerning him;


[GNSS|07ED]and they brought him on
[GNSS|07EE]the way, and his wife,
[GNSS|07EF]and all that he had.


[GNSS|07F0]13,1 And Abram
[GNSS|07F1]went up out
[GNSS|07F2]of Egypt, he,
[GNSS|07F3]and his wife,
[GNSS|07F4]and all that he had,
[GNSS|07F5]and Lot with him, into
[GNSS|07F6]the South.


[GNSS|07F7]13,2 And Abram was very
[GNSS|07F8]rich in cattle, in silver,
[GNSS|07F9]and in gold.


[GNSS|07FA]13,3 And he
[GNSS|07FB]went on his journeys from
[GNSS|07FC]the South even to Beth-el,
[GNSS|07FD]unto the place
[GNSS|07FE]where his tent
[GNSS|07FF]had been at
[GNSS|0800]the beginning, between Beth-el
[GNSS|0801]and Ai; 13,4 unto
[GNSS|0802]the place of
[GNSS|0803]the altar, which he
[GNSS|0804]had made there at
[GNSS|0805]the first;


[GNSS|0806]and Abram called there on
[GNSS|0807]the name of
[GNSS|0808]the LORD.


[GNSS|0809]13,5 And Lot also,
[GNSS|080A]who went with Abram,
[GNSS|080B]had flocks, and herds,
[GNSS|080C]and tents.


[GNSS|080D]13,6 And the land was
[GNSS|080E]not able to bear them,
[GNSS|080F]that they might dwell together;


[GNSS|0810]for their substance was great,
[GNSS|0811]so that they
[GNSS|0812]could not dwell together.


[GNSS|0813]13,7 And there was
[GNSS|0814]a strife between
[GNSS|0815]the herdmen of Abram's cattle
[GNSS|0816]and the herdmen
[GNSS|0817]of Lot's cattle.


[GNSS|0818]And the Canaanite
[GNSS|0819]and the Perizzite dwelt
[GNSS|081A]then in the land.


[GNSS|081B]13,8 And Abram
[GNSS|081C]said unto Lot: 'Let there
[GNSS|081D]be no strife, I pray
[GNSS|081E]thee, between me
[GNSS|081F]and thee, and between my
[GNSS|0820]herdmen and thy herdmen;


[GNSS|0821]for we are brethren.


[GNSS|0822]13,9 Is not
[GNSS|0823]the whole land
[GNSS|0824]before thee? separate thyself, I
[GNSS|0825]pray thee, from me;
[GNSS|0826]if thou wilt take
[GNSS|0827]the left hand,
[GNSS|0828]then I will
[GNSS|0829]go to the right;


[GNSS|082A]or if thou take
[GNSS|082B]the right hand,
[GNSS|082C]then I will
[GNSS|082D]go to the left.' 13,10
[GNSS|082E]And Lot lifted up his
[GNSS|082F]eyes, and beheld all
[GNSS|0830]the plain of
[GNSS|0831]the Jordan, that it was
[GNSS|0832]well watered every where,
[GNSS|0833]before the LORD
[GNSS|0834]destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah,
[GNSS|0835]like the garden
[GNSS|0836]of the LORD,
[GNSS|0837]like the land
[GNSS|0838]of Egypt, as thou goest
[GNSS|0839]unto Zoar.


[GNSS|083A]13,11 So Lot chose him
[GNSS|083B]all the plain
[GNSS|083C]of the Jordan;


[GNSS|083D]and Lot journeyed east;


[GNSS|083E]and they separated themselves
[GNSS|083F]the one from
[GNSS|0840]the other.


[GNSS|0841]13,12 Abram dwelt in
[GNSS|0842]the land of Canaan,
[GNSS|0843]and Lot dwelt in
[GNSS|0844]the cities of
[GNSS|0845]the Plain, and
[GNSS|0846]moved his tent
[GNSS|0847]as far as Sodom.


[GNSS|0848]13,13 Now the men
[GNSS|0849]of Sodom were
[GNSS|084A]wicked and sinners against
[GNSS|084B]the LORD exceedingly.


[GNSS|084C]13,14 And the LORD
[GNSS|084D]said unto Abram,
[GNSS|084E]after that Lot was
[GNSS|084F]separated from him: 'Lift up
[GNSS|0850]now thine eyes,
[GNSS|0851]and look from
[GNSS|0852]the place where thou art,
[GNSS|0853]northward and southward
[GNSS|0854]and eastward and westward;


[GNSS|0855]13,15 for all
[GNSS|0856]the land which thou seest,
[GNSS|0857]to thee will I give
[GNSS|0858]it, and to thy seed
[GNSS|0859]for ever.


[GNSS|085A]13,16 And I
[GNSS|085B]will make thy seed
[GNSS|085C]as the dust
[GNSS|085D]of the earth;


[GNSS|085E]so that if
[GNSS|085F]a man can number
[GNSS|0860]the dust of
[GNSS|0861]the earth, then shall thy
[GNSS|0862]seed also be numbered.


[GNSS|0863]13,17 Arise, walk through
[GNSS|0864]the land in
[GNSS|0865]the length of it
[GNSS|0866]and in the breadth
[GNSS|0867]of it; for unto thee
[GNSS|0868]will I give it.' 13,18
[GNSS|0869]And Abram moved his tent,
[GNSS|086A]and came and dwelt
[GNSS|086B]by the terebinths
[GNSS|086C]of Mamre, which are in
[GNSS|086D]Hebron, and built there an
[GNSS|086E]altar unto the LORD.


[GNSS|086F]{P}  14,1
[GNSS|0870]And it came to pass
[GNSS|0871]in the days
[GNSS|0872]of Amraphel king
[GNSS|0873]of Shinar, Arioch king
[GNSS|0874]of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king
[GNSS|0875]of Elam, and Tidal king
[GNSS|0876]of Goiim, 14,2 that they
[GNSS|0877]made war with Bera king
[GNSS|0878]of Sodom, and
[GNSS|0879]with Birsha king
[GNSS|087A]of Gomorrah, Shinab king
[GNSS|087B]of Admah, and Shemeber king
[GNSS|087C]of Zeboiim, and
[GNSS|087D]the king of Bela-the same
[GNSS|087E]is Zoar.


[GNSS|087F]14,3 All these came
[GNSS|0880]as allies unto
[GNSS|0881]the vale of Siddim-the same
[GNSS|0882]is the Salt Sea.


[GNSS|0883]14,4 Twelve years they
[GNSS|0884]served Chedorlaomer, and in
[GNSS|0885]the thirteenth year they rebelled.


[GNSS|0886]14,5 And in
[GNSS|0887]the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer
[GNSS|0888]and the kings that were
[GNSS|0889]with him, and smote
[GNSS|088A]the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim,
[GNSS|088B]and the Zuzim in Ham,
[GNSS|088C]and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,
[GNSS|088D]14,6 and the Horites in
[GNSS|088E]their mount Seir, unto El-paran,
[GNSS|088F]which is by
[GNSS|0890]the wilderness.


[GNSS|0891]14,7 And they
[GNSS|0892]turned back, and came to
[GNSS|0893]En-mishpat-the same is Kadesh-and smote
[GNSS|0894]all the country
[GNSS|0895]of the Amalekites,
[GNSS|0896]and also the Amorites, that
[GNSS|0897]dwelt in Hazazon-tamar.


[GNSS|0898]14,8 And there
[GNSS|0899]went out the king
[GNSS|089A]of Sodom, and
[GNSS|089B]the king of Gomorrah,
[GNSS|089C]and the king
[GNSS|089D]of Admah, and
[GNSS|089E]the king of Zeboiim,
[GNSS|089F]and the king
[GNSS|08A0]of Bela-the same is Zoar;


[GNSS|08A1]and they set
[GNSS|08A2]the battle in array against
[GNSS|08A3]them in the vale
[GNSS|08A4]of Siddim;


[GNSS|08A5]14,9 against Chedorlaomer king
[GNSS|08A6]of Elam, and Tidal king
[GNSS|08A7]of Goiim, and Amraphel king
[GNSS|08A8]of Shinar, and Arioch king
[GNSS|08A9]of Ellasar;


[GNSS|08AA]four kings against
[GNSS|08AB]the five.


[GNSS|08AC]14,10 Now the vale
[GNSS|08AD]of Siddim was full
[GNSS|08AE]of slime pits;


[GNSS|08AF]and the kings
[GNSS|08B0]of Sodom and Gomorrah fled,
[GNSS|08B1]and they fell there,
[GNSS|08B2]and they that
[GNSS|08B3]remained fled to
[GNSS|08B4]the mountain.


[GNSS|08B5]14,11 And they took all
[GNSS|08B6]the goods of Sodom
[GNSS|08B7]and Gomorrah, and all their
[GNSS|08B8]victuals, and went their way.


[GNSS|08B9]14,12 And they took Lot,
[GNSS|08BA]Abram's brother's son,
[GNSS|08BB]who dwelt in Sodom,
[GNSS|08BC]and his goods,
[GNSS|08BD]and departed.


[GNSS|08BE]14,13 And there came one
[GNSS|08BF]that had escaped,
[GNSS|08C0]and told Abram
[GNSS|08C1]the Hebrew-now he dwelt
[GNSS|08C2]by the terebinths
[GNSS|08C3]of Mamre the Amorite, brother
[GNSS|08C4]of Eshcol, and brother
[GNSS|08C5]of Aner;


[GNSS|08C6]and these were confederate
[GNSS|08C7]with Abram.


[GNSS|08C8]14,14 And when Abram heard
[GNSS|08C9]that his brother was taken
[GNSS|08CA]captive, he led forth his
[GNSS|08CB]trained men, born in his
[GNSS|08CC]house, three hundred
[GNSS|08CD]and eighteen, and
[GNSS|08CE]pursued as far
[GNSS|08CF]as Dan.


[GNSS|08D0]14,15 And he
[GNSS|08D1]divided himself against them
[GNSS|08D2]by night, he
[GNSS|08D3]and his servants,
[GNSS|08D4]and smote them,
[GNSS|08D5]and pursued them unto Hobah,
[GNSS|08D6]which is on
[GNSS|08D7]the left hand
[GNSS|08D8]of Damascus.


[GNSS|08D9]14,16 And he brought back
[GNSS|08DA]all the goods,
[GNSS|08DB]and also brought back his
[GNSS|08DC]brother Lot, and his goods,
[GNSS|08DD]and the women also,
[GNSS|08DE]and the people.


[GNSS|08DF]14,17 And the king
[GNSS|08E0]of Sodom went out to
[GNSS|08E1]meet him, after his return
[GNSS|08E2]from the slaughter
[GNSS|08E3]of Chedorlaomer and
[GNSS|08E4]the kings that were
[GNSS|08E5]with him, at
[GNSS|08E6]the vale of Shaveh-the same
[GNSS|08E7]is the King's Vale.


[GNSS|08E8]14,18 And Melchizedek king
[GNSS|08E9]of Salem brought forth bread
[GNSS|08EA]and wine;


[GNSS|08EB]and he was priest
[GNSS|08EC]of God the
[GNSS|08ED]Most High.


[GNSS|08EE]14,19 And he
[GNSS|08EF]blessed him, and said:
[GNSS|08F0]'Blessed be Abram
[GNSS|08F1]of God Most High, Maker
[GNSS|08F2]of heaven and earth;


[GNSS|08F3]14,20 and blessed be God
[GNSS|08F4]the Most High,
[GNSS|08F5]who hath delivered thine enemies
[GNSS|08F6]into thy hand.'
[GNSS|08F7]And he gave him
[GNSS|08F8]a tenth of all.


[GNSS|08F9]14,21 And the king
[GNSS|08FA]of Sodom said unto Abram:
[GNSS|08FB]'Give me the persons,
[GNSS|08FC]and take the goods to
[GNSS|08FD]thyself.' 14,22 And Abram
[GNSS|08FE]said to the king
[GNSS|08FF]of Sodom: 'I
[GNSS|0900]have lifted up my hand
[GNSS|0901]unto the LORD, God
[GNSS|0902]Most High, Maker
[GNSS|0903]of heaven and earth, 14,23
[GNSS|0904]that I will
[GNSS|0905]not take a thread
[GNSS|0906]nor a shoe-latchet
[GNSS|0907]nor aught that is thine,
[GNSS|0908]lest thou shouldest say: I
[GNSS|0909]have made Abram rich;


[GNSS|090A]14,24 save only that
[GNSS|090B]which the young men
[GNSS|090C]have eaten, and
[GNSS|090D]the portion of
[GNSS|090E]the men which
[GNSS|090F]went with me, Aner, Eshcol,
[GNSS|0910]and Mamre, let them take
[GNSS|0911]their portion.' {S} 15,1
[GNSS|0912]After these things
[GNSS|0913]the word of
[GNSS|0914]the LORD came unto Abram
[GNSS|0915]in a vision, saying: 'Fear
[GNSS|0916]not, Abram, I am thy
[GNSS|0917]shield, thy reward shall be
[GNSS|0918]exceeding great.' 15,2
[GNSS|0919]And Abram said: 'O Lord
[GNSS|091A]GOD, what wilt Thou give
[GNSS|091B]me, seeing I
[GNSS|091C]go hence childless,
[GNSS|091D]and he that shall be
[GNSS|091E]possessor of my house is
[GNSS|091F]Eliezer of Damascus?' 15,3
[GNSS|0920]And Abram said: 'Behold, to
[GNSS|0921]me Thou hast given
[GNSS|0922]no seed, and, lo, one
[GNSS|0923]born in my house is
[GNSS|0924]to be mine heir.' 15,4
[GNSS|0925]And, behold, the word
[GNSS|0926]of the LORD came unto
[GNSS|0927]him, saying: 'This man shall
[GNSS|0928]not be thine heir;


[GNSS|0929]but he that shall come
[GNSS|092A]forth out of thine own
[GNSS|092B]bowels shall be thine heir.'
[GNSS|092C]15,5 And He brought him
[GNSS|092D]forth abroad, and said: 'Look
[GNSS|092E]now toward heaven,
[GNSS|092F]and count the stars,
[GNSS|0930]if thou be able to
[GNSS|0931]count them';


[GNSS|0932]and He said unto him:
[GNSS|0933]'So shall thy seed be.'
[GNSS|0934]15,6 And he
[GNSS|0935]believed in the LORD;


[GNSS|0936]and He counted it to
[GNSS|0937]him for righteousness.


[GNSS|0938]15,7 And He
[GNSS|0939]said unto him: 'I am
[GNSS|093A]the LORD that brought thee
[GNSS|093B]out of Ur
[GNSS|093C]of the Chaldees, to give
[GNSS|093D]thee this land to inherit
[GNSS|093E]it.' 15,8 And he said:
[GNSS|093F]'O Lord GOD,
[GNSS|0940]whereby shall I know that
[GNSS|0941]I shall inherit it?' 15,9
[GNSS|0942]And He said unto him:
[GNSS|0943]'Take Me a heifer
[GNSS|0944]of three years old,
[GNSS|0945]and a she-goat
[GNSS|0946]of three years old,
[GNSS|0947]and a ram
[GNSS|0948]of three years old,
[GNSS|0949]and a turtle-dove,
[GNSS|094A]and a young pigeon.' 15,10
[GNSS|094B]And he took him all
[GNSS|094C]these, and divided them in
[GNSS|094D]the midst, and laid each
[GNSS|094E]half over against
[GNSS|094F]the other;


[GNSS|0950]but the birds
[GNSS|0951]divided he not.


[GNSS|0952]15,11 And the birds
[GNSS|0953]of prey came down upon
[GNSS|0954]the carcasses, and Abram drove
[GNSS|0955]them away.


[GNSS|0956]15,12 And it came to
[GNSS|0957]pass, that, when
[GNSS|0958]the sun was
[GNSS|0959]going down, a deep sleep
[GNSS|095A]fell upon Abram;


[GNSS|095B]and, lo, a dread,
[GNSS|095C]even a great darkness, fell
[GNSS|095D]upon him.


[GNSS|095E]15,13 And He
[GNSS|095F]said unto Abram: 'Know
[GNSS|0960]of a surety that thy
[GNSS|0961]seed shall be
[GNSS|0962]a stranger in
[GNSS|0963]a land that is
[GNSS|0964]not theirs, and shall serve
[GNSS|0965]them;


[GNSS|0966]and they shall afflict them
[GNSS|0967]four hundred years;


[GNSS|0968]15,14 and also that nation,
[GNSS|0969]whom they shall serve,
[GNSS|096A]will I judge;


[GNSS|096B]and afterward shall they come
[GNSS|096C]out with great substance.


[GNSS|096D]15,15 But thou shalt
[GNSS|096E]go to thy fathers in
[GNSS|096F]peace;


[GNSS|0970]thou shalt be
[GNSS|0971]buried in a good old
[GNSS|0972]age.


[GNSS|0973]15,16 And in
[GNSS|0974]the fourth generation they shall
[GNSS|0975]come back hither;


[GNSS|0976]for the iniquity
[GNSS|0977]of the Amorite is
[GNSS|0978]not yet full.' 15,17
[GNSS|0979]And it came to pass,
[GNSS|097A]that, when the sun
[GNSS|097B]went down, and there was
[GNSS|097C]thick darkness, behold
[GNSS|097D]a smoking furnace,
[GNSS|097E]and a flaming torch that
[GNSS|097F]passed between these pieces.


[GNSS|0980]15,18 In that day
[GNSS|0981]the LORD made
[GNSS|0982]a covenant with Abram, saying:
[GNSS|0983]'Unto thy seed
[GNSS|0984]have I given this land,
[GNSS|0985]from the river
[GNSS|0986]of Egypt unto
[GNSS|0987]the great river,
[GNSS|0988]the river Euphrates;


[GNSS|0989]15,19 the Kenite,
[GNSS|098A]and the Kenizzite,
[GNSS|098B]and the Kadmonite, 15,20
[GNSS|098C]and the Hittite,
[GNSS|098D]and the Perizzite,
[GNSS|098E]and the Rephaim, 15,21
[GNSS|098F]and the Amorite,
[GNSS|0990]and the Canaanite,
[GNSS|0991]and the Girgashite,
[GNSS|0992]and the Jebusite.' {S} 16,1
[GNSS|0993]Now Sarai Abram's wife bore
[GNSS|0994]him no children;


[GNSS|0995]and she had
[GNSS|0996]a handmaid, an Egyptian,
[GNSS|0997]whose name was Hagar.


[GNSS|0998]16,2 And Sarai
[GNSS|0999]said unto Abram: 'Behold now,
[GNSS|099A]the LORD hath
[GNSS|099B]restrained me from bearing;


[GNSS|099C]go in, I pray thee,
[GNSS|099D]unto my handmaid;


[GNSS|099E]it may be that I
[GNSS|099F]shall be builded up through
[GNSS|09A0]her.' And Abram
[GNSS|09A1]hearkened to the voice
[GNSS|09A2]of Sarai.


[GNSS|09A3]16,3 And Sarai Abram's wife
[GNSS|09A4]took Hagar the Egyptian, her
[GNSS|09A5]handmaid, after Abram
[GNSS|09A6]had dwelt ten years in
[GNSS|09A7]the land of Canaan,
[GNSS|09A8]and gave her to Abram
[GNSS|09A9]her husband to be his
[GNSS|09AA]wife.


[GNSS|09AB]16,4 And he
[GNSS|09AC]went in unto Hagar,
[GNSS|09AD]and she conceived;


[GNSS|09AE]and when she saw that
[GNSS|09AF]she had conceived, her mistress
[GNSS|09B0]was despised in her eyes.


[GNSS|09B1]16,5 And Sarai
[GNSS|09B2]said unto Abram: 'My wrong
[GNSS|09B3]be upon thee: I gave
[GNSS|09B4]my handmaid into thy bosom;


[GNSS|09B5]and when she saw that
[GNSS|09B6]she had conceived, I was
[GNSS|09B7]despised in her eyes:
[GNSS|09B8]the LORD judge between me
[GNSS|09B9]and thee.' 16,6
[GNSS|09BA]But Abram said unto Sarai:
[GNSS|09BB]'Behold, thy maid is in
[GNSS|09BC]thy hand;


[GNSS|09BD]do to her that
[GNSS|09BE]which is good in thine
[GNSS|09BF]eyes.' And Sarai dealt harshly
[GNSS|09C0]with her, and she fled
[GNSS|09C1]from her face.


[GNSS|09C2]16,7 And the angel
[GNSS|09C3]of the LORD found her
[GNSS|09C4]by a fountain
[GNSS|09C5]of water in
[GNSS|09C6]the wilderness, by
[GNSS|09C7]the fountain in
[GNSS|09C8]the way to Shur.


[GNSS|09C9]16,8 And he said: 'Hagar,
[GNSS|09CA]Sarai's handmaid, whence camest thou?
[GNSS|09CB]and whither goest thou?'
[GNSS|09CC]And she said: 'I flee
[GNSS|09CD]from the face
[GNSS|09CE]of my mistress Sarai.' 16,9
[GNSS|09CF]And the angel
[GNSS|09D0]of the LORD
[GNSS|09D1]said unto her: 'Return to
[GNSS|09D2]thy mistress, and submit thyself
[GNSS|09D3]under her hands.' 16,10
[GNSS|09D4]And the angel
[GNSS|09D5]of the LORD
[GNSS|09D6]said unto her: 'I
[GNSS|09D7]will greatly multiply thy seed,
[GNSS|09D8]that it shall
[GNSS|09D9]not be numbered
[GNSS|09DA]for multitude.


[GNSS|09DB]16,11 And the angel
[GNSS|09DC]of the LORD
[GNSS|09DD]said unto her: 'Behold, thou
[GNSS|09DE]art with child,
[GNSS|09DF]and shalt bear
[GNSS|09E0]a son;


[GNSS|09E1]and thou shalt call his
[GNSS|09E2]name Ishmael, because
[GNSS|09E3]the LORD hath heard thy
[GNSS|09E4]affliction.


[GNSS|09E5]16,12 And he shall be
[GNSS|09E6]a wild ass
[GNSS|09E7]of a man: his hand
[GNSS|09E8]shall be against every man,
[GNSS|09E9]and every man's hand against
[GNSS|09EA]him;


[GNSS|09EB]and he shall dwell in
[GNSS|09EC]the face of all his
[GNSS|09ED]brethren.' 16,13 And she
[GNSS|09EE]called the name
[GNSS|09EF]of the LORD that spoke
[GNSS|09F0]unto her, Thou art
[GNSS|09F1]a God of seeing;


[GNSS|09F2]for she said: 'Have I
[GNSS|09F3]even here seen Him that
[GNSS|09F4]seeth Me?' 16,14
[GNSS|09F5]Wherefore the well was
[GNSS|09F6]called 'Beer-lahai-roi;


[GNSS|09F7]behold, it is between Kadesh
[GNSS|09F8]and Bered.


[GNSS|09F9]16,15 And Hagar bore Abram
[GNSS|09FA]a son;


[GNSS|09FB]and Abram called
[GNSS|09FC]the name of his son,
[GNSS|09FD]whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.


[GNSS|09FE]16,16 And Abram was fourscore
[GNSS|09FF]and six years old,
[GNSS|0A00]when Hagar bore Ishmael to
[GNSS|0A01]Abram.


[GNSS|0A02]{S} 17,1 And
[GNSS|0A03]when Abram was ninety years
[GNSS|0A04]old and nine,
[GNSS|0A05]the LORD appeared to Abram,
[GNSS|0A06]and said unto him: 'I
[GNSS|0A07]am God Almighty;


[GNSS|0A08]walk before Me,
[GNSS|0A09]and be thou wholehearted.


[GNSS|0A0A]17,2 And I
[GNSS|0A0B]will make My covenant between
[GNSS|0A0C]Me and thee,
[GNSS|0A0D]and will multiply thee exceedingly.'
[GNSS|0A0E]17,3 And Abram fell on
[GNSS|0A0F]his face;


[GNSS|0A10]and God talked
[GNSS|0A11]with him, saying: 17,4 'As
[GNSS|0A12]for Me, behold, My covenant
[GNSS|0A13]is with thee,
[GNSS|0A14]and thou shalt be
[GNSS|0A15]the father of
[GNSS|0A16]a multitude of nations.


[GNSS|0A17]17,5 Neither shall thy name
[GNSS|0A18]any more be
[GNSS|0A19]called Abram, but thy name
[GNSS|0A1A]shall be Abraham;


[GNSS|0A1B]for the father
[GNSS|0A1C]of a multitude
[GNSS|0A1D]of nations have I
[GNSS|0A1E]made thee.


[GNSS|0A1F]17,6 And I
[GNSS|0A20]will make thee
[GNSS|0A21]exceeding fruitful, and I
[GNSS|0A22]will make nations
[GNSS|0A23]of thee, and kings shall
[GNSS|0A24]come out of thee.


[GNSS|0A25]17,7 And I
[GNSS|0A26]will establish My covenant between
[GNSS|0A27]Me and thee
[GNSS|0A28]and thy seed
[GNSS|0A29]after thee throughout their generations
[GNSS|0A2A]for an everlasting covenant, to
[GNSS|0A2B]be a God unto thee
[GNSS|0A2C]and to thy seed
[GNSS|0A2D]after thee.


[GNSS|0A2E]17,8 And I
[GNSS|0A2F]will give unto thee,
[GNSS|0A30]and to thy seed
[GNSS|0A31]after thee, the land
[GNSS|0A32]of thy sojournings, all
[GNSS|0A33]the land of Canaan,
[GNSS|0A34]for an everlasting possession;


[GNSS|0A35]and I will be their
[GNSS|0A36]God.' 17,9 And God
[GNSS|0A37]said unto Abraham: 'And
[GNSS|0A38]as for thee, thou shalt
[GNSS|0A39]keep My covenant, thou,
[GNSS|0A3A]and thy seed
[GNSS|0A3B]after thee throughout their generations.


[GNSS|0A3C]17,10 This is My covenant,
[GNSS|0A3D]which ye shall keep, between
[GNSS|0A3E]Me and you
[GNSS|0A3F]and thy seed
[GNSS|0A40]after thee: every male among
[GNSS|0A41]you shall be circumcised.


[GNSS|0A42]17,11 And ye shall be
[GNSS|0A43]circumcised in the flesh
[GNSS|0A44]of your foreskin;


[GNSS|0A45]and it shall be
[GNSS|0A46]a token of
[GNSS|0A47]a covenant betwixt Me
[GNSS|0A48]and you.


[GNSS|0A49]17,12 And he that is
[GNSS|0A4A]eight days old shall be
[GNSS|0A4B]circumcised among you, every male
[GNSS|0A4C]throughout your generations, he that
[GNSS|0A4D]is born in
[GNSS|0A4E]the house, or bought
[GNSS|0A4F]with money of any foreigner,
[GNSS|0A50]that is not
[GNSS|0A51]of thy seed.


[GNSS|0A52]17,13 He that is born
[GNSS|0A53]in thy house,
[GNSS|0A54]and he that is bought
[GNSS|0A55]with thy money,
[GNSS|0A56]must needs be circumcised;


[GNSS|0A57]and My covenant shall be
[GNSS|0A58]in your flesh
[GNSS|0A59]for an everlasting covenant.


[GNSS|0A5A]17,14 And the
[GNSS|0A5B]uncircumcised male who is
[GNSS|0A5C]not circumcised in
[GNSS|0A5D]the flesh of his foreskin,
[GNSS|0A5E]that soul shall be cut
[GNSS|0A5F]off from his people;


[GNSS|0A60]he hath broken My covenant.'
[GNSS|0A61]{S} 17,15 And God
[GNSS|0A62]said unto Abraham: 'As
[GNSS|0A63]for Sarai thy wife, thou
[GNSS|0A64]shalt not call her name
[GNSS|0A65]Sarai, but Sarah shall her
[GNSS|0A66]name be. 17,16
[GNSS|0A67]And I will bless her,
[GNSS|0A68]and moreover I
[GNSS|0A69]will give thee
[GNSS|0A6A]a son of her;


[GNSS|0A6B]yea, I will bless her,
[GNSS|0A6C]and she shall be
[GNSS|0A6D]a mother of nations;


[GNSS|0A6E]kings of peoples shall be
[GNSS|0A6F]of her.' 17,17
[GNSS|0A70]Then Abraham fell upon his
[GNSS|0A71]face, and laughed,
[GNSS|0A72]and said in his heart:
[GNSS|0A73]'Shall a child be born
[GNSS|0A74]unto him that is
[GNSS|0A75]a hundred years old?
[GNSS|0A76]and shall Sarah, that is
[GNSS|0A77]ninety years old, bear?' 17,18
[GNSS|0A78]And Abraham said unto God:
[GNSS|0A79]'Oh that Ishmael might live
[GNSS|0A7A]before Thee!' 17,19
[GNSS|0A7B]And God said: 'Nay,
[GNSS|0A7C]but Sarah thy wife shall
[GNSS|0A7D]bear thee a son;


[GNSS|0A7E]and thou shalt call his
[GNSS|0A7F]name Isaac;


[GNSS|0A80]and I will establish My
[GNSS|0A81]covenant with him
[GNSS|0A82]for an everlasting covenant
[GNSS|0A83]for his seed
[GNSS|0A84]after him.


[GNSS|0A85]17,20 And as
[GNSS|0A86]for Ishmael, I
[GNSS|0A87]have heard thee;


[GNSS|0A88]behold, I have
[GNSS|0A89]blessed him, and
[GNSS|0A8A]will make him fruitful,
[GNSS|0A8B]and will multiply him exceedingly;


[GNSS|0A8C]twelve princes shall he beget,
[GNSS|0A8D]and I will
[GNSS|0A8E]make him a great nation.


[GNSS|0A8F]17,21 But My covenant
[GNSS|0A90]will I establish
[GNSS|0A91]with Isaac, whom Sarah shall
[GNSS|0A92]bear unto thee at this
[GNSS|0A93]set time in
[GNSS|0A94]the next year.' 17,22
[GNSS|0A95]And He left off
[GNSS|0A96]talking with him,
[GNSS|0A97]and God went up from
[GNSS|0A98]Abraham.


[GNSS|0A99]17,23 And Abraham took Ishmael
[GNSS|0A9A]his son, and all that
[GNSS|0A9B]were born in his house,
[GNSS|0A9C]and all that were bought
[GNSS|0A9D]with his money, every male
[GNSS|0A9E]among the men
[GNSS|0A9F]of Abraham's house,
[GNSS|0AA0]and circumcised the flesh
[GNSS|0AA1]of their foreskin in
[GNSS|0AA2]the selfsame day,
[GNSS|0AA3]as God had
[GNSS|0AA4]said unto him.


[GNSS|0AA5]17,24 And Abraham was ninety
[GNSS|0AA6]years old and nine,
[GNSS|0AA7]when he was
[GNSS|0AA8]circumcised in the flesh
[GNSS|0AA9]of his foreskin.


[GNSS|0AAA]17,25 And Ishmael his son
[GNSS|0AAB]was thirteen years old,
[GNSS|0AAC]when he was
[GNSS|0AAD]circumcised in the flesh
[GNSS|0AAE]of his foreskin.


[GNSS|0AAF]17,26 In the selfsame day
[GNSS|0AB0]was Abraham circumcised,
[GNSS|0AB1]and Ishmael his son.


[GNSS|0AB2]17,27 And all
[GNSS|0AB3]the men of his house,
[GNSS|0AB4]those born in
[GNSS|0AB5]the house, and those bought
[GNSS|0AB6]with money of
[GNSS|0AB7]a foreigner, were
[GNSS|0AB8]circumcised with him.


[GNSS|0AB9]{P}  18,1
[GNSS|0ABA]And the LORD
[GNSS|0ABB]appeared unto him
[GNSS|0ABC]by the terebinths
[GNSS|0ABD]of Mamre, as he sat
[GNSS|0ABE]in the tent door in
[GNSS|0ABF]the heat of
[GNSS|0AC0]the day;


[GNSS|0AC1]18,2 and he
[GNSS|0AC2]lifted up his eyes
[GNSS|0AC3]and looked, and, lo, three
[GNSS|0AC4]men stood over against him;


[GNSS|0AC5]and when he saw them,
[GNSS|0AC6]he ran to meet them
[GNSS|0AC7]from the tent door,
[GNSS|0AC8]and bowed down to
[GNSS|0AC9]the earth, 18,3
[GNSS|0ACA]and said: 'My lord,
[GNSS|0ACB]if now I
[GNSS|0ACC]have found favour in thy
[GNSS|0ACD]sight, pass not away, I
[GNSS|0ACE]pray thee, from thy servant.


[GNSS|0ACF]18,4 Let now
[GNSS|0AD0]a little water be fetched,
[GNSS|0AD1]and wash your feet,
[GNSS|0AD2]and recline yourselves under
[GNSS|0AD3]the tree.


[GNSS|0AD4]18,5 And I
[GNSS|0AD5]will fetch a morsel
[GNSS|0AD6]of bread, and stay ye
[GNSS|0AD7]your heart;


[GNSS|0AD8]after that ye shall pass
[GNSS|0AD9]on; forasmuch as ye are
[GNSS|0ADA]come to your servant.'
[GNSS|0ADB]And they said: 'So do,
[GNSS|0ADC]as thou hast said.' 18,6
[GNSS|0ADD]And Abraham hastened into
[GNSS|0ADE]the tent unto Sarah,
[GNSS|0ADF]and said: 'Make ready quickly
[GNSS|0AE0]three measures of fine meal,
[GNSS|0AE1]knead it, and
[GNSS|0AE2]make cakes.' 18,7
[GNSS|0AE3]And Abraham ran unto
[GNSS|0AE4]the herd, and
[GNSS|0AE5]fetched a calf tender
[GNSS|0AE6]and good, and gave it
[GNSS|0AE7]unto the servant;


[GNSS|0AE8]and he hastened to dress
[GNSS|0AE9]it. 18,8 And he took
[GNSS|0AEA]curd, and milk,
[GNSS|0AEB]and the calf
[GNSS|0AEC]which he had dressed,
[GNSS|0AED]and set it
[GNSS|0AEE]before them;


[GNSS|0AEF]and he stood
[GNSS|0AF0]by them under
[GNSS|0AF1]the tree, and they did
[GNSS|0AF2]eat.


[GNSS|0AF3]18,9 And they
[GNSS|0AF4]said unto him: 'Where is
[GNSS|0AF5]Sarah thy wife?'
[GNSS|0AF6]And he said: 'Behold, in
[GNSS|0AF7]the tent.' 18,10
[GNSS|0AF8]And He said: 'I
[GNSS|0AF9]will certainly return unto thee
[GNSS|0AFA]when the season cometh round;


[GNSS|0AFB]and, lo, Sarah thy wife
[GNSS|0AFC]shall have a son.'
[GNSS|0AFD]And Sarah heard in
[GNSS|0AFE]the tent door,
[GNSS|0AFF]which was behind him.- 18,11
[GNSS|0B00]Now Abraham and Sarah were
[GNSS|0B01]old, and well stricken in
[GNSS|0B02]age;


[GNSS|0B03]it had ceased to be
[GNSS|0B04]with Sarah after
[GNSS|0B05]the manner of women.- 18,12
[GNSS|0B06]And Sarah laughed within herself,
[GNSS|0B07]saying: 'After I am
[GNSS|0B08]waxed old shall I
[GNSS|0B09]have pleasure, my lord
[GNSS|0B0A]being old also?' 18,13
[GNSS|0B0B]And the LORD
[GNSS|0B0C]said unto Abraham: 'Wherefore did
[GNSS|0B0D]Sarah laugh, saying: Shall I
[GNSS|0B0E]of a surety bear
[GNSS|0B0F]a child, who am old?
[GNSS|0B10]18,14 Is any
[GNSS|0B11]thing too hard
[GNSS|0B12]for the LORD.


[GNSS|0B13]At the set
[GNSS|0B14]time I will return unto
[GNSS|0B15]thee, when the season cometh
[GNSS|0B16]round, and Sarah shall
[GNSS|0B17]have a son.' 18,15
[GNSS|0B18]Then Sarah denied, saying: 'I
[GNSS|0B19]laughed not';


[GNSS|0B1A]for she was afraid.


[GNSS|0B1B]And He said: 'Nay;


[GNSS|0B1C]but thou didst laugh.' 18,16
[GNSS|0B1D]And the men rose up
[GNSS|0B1E]from thence, and
[GNSS|0B1F]looked out toward Sodom;


[GNSS|0B20]and Abraham went
[GNSS|0B21]with them to
[GNSS|0B22]bring them on
[GNSS|0B23]the way.


[GNSS|0B24]18,17 And the LORD said:
[GNSS|0B25]'Shall I hide from Abraham
[GNSS|0B26]that which I am doing;


[GNSS|0B27]18,18 seeing that Abraham shall
[GNSS|0B28]surely become a great
[GNSS|0B29]and mighty nation,
[GNSS|0B2A]and all the nations
[GNSS|0B2B]of the earth shall be
[GNSS|0B2C]blessed in him? 18,19
[GNSS|0B2D]For I have known him,
[GNSS|0B2E]to the end that he
[GNSS|0B2F]may command his children
[GNSS|0B30]and his household
[GNSS|0B31]after him, that they may
[GNSS|0B32]keep the way
[GNSS|0B33]of the LORD, to
[GNSS|0B34]do righteousness and justice;


[GNSS|0B35]to the end that
[GNSS|0B36]the LORD may
[GNSS|0B37]bring upon Abraham that
[GNSS|0B38]which He hath spoken
[GNSS|0B39]of him.' 18,20
[GNSS|0B3A]And the LORD said: 'Verily,
[GNSS|0B3B]the cry of Sodom
[GNSS|0B3C]and Gomorrah is great, and,
[GNSS|0B3D]verily, their sin is
[GNSS|0B3E]exceeding grievous.


[GNSS|0B3F]18,21 I will
[GNSS|0B40]go down now,
[GNSS|0B41]and see whether they
[GNSS|0B42]have done altogether
[GNSS|0B43]according to the cry
[GNSS|0B44]of it, which is come
[GNSS|0B45]unto Me; and
[GNSS|0B46]if not, I
[GNSS|0B47]will know.' 18,22
[GNSS|0B48]And the men
[GNSS|0B49]turned from thence,
[GNSS|0B4A]and went toward Sodom;


[GNSS|0B4B]but Abraham stood
[GNSS|0B4C]yet before the LORD.


[GNSS|0B4D]18,23 And Abraham drew near,
[GNSS|0B4E]and said: 'Wilt Thou
[GNSS|0B4F]indeed sweep away
[GNSS|0B50]the righteous with
[GNSS|0B51]the wicked? 18,24 Peradventure there
[GNSS|0B52]are fifty righteous within
[GNSS|0B53]the city;


[GNSS|0B54]wilt Thou indeed sweep away
[GNSS|0B55]and not forgive
[GNSS|0B56]the place for
[GNSS|0B57]the fifty righteous that are
[GNSS|0B58]therein? 18,25 That be far
[GNSS|0B59]from Thee to
[GNSS|0B5A]do after this manner, to
[GNSS|0B5B]slay the righteous
[GNSS|0B5C]with the wicked, that
[GNSS|0B5D]so the righteous should be
[GNSS|0B5E]as the wicked;


[GNSS|0B5F]that be far from Thee;


[GNSS|0B60]shall not the Judge
[GNSS|0B61]of all the earth
[GNSS|0B62]do justly?' 18,26
[GNSS|0B63]And the LORD said: 'If
[GNSS|0B64]I find in Sodom fifty
[GNSS|0B65]righteous within the city,
[GNSS|0B66]then I will forgive all
[GNSS|0B67]the place for their sake.'
[GNSS|0B68]18,27 And Abraham
[GNSS|0B69]answered and said: 'Behold now,
[GNSS|0B6A]I have taken upon me
[GNSS|0B6B]to speak unto
[GNSS|0B6C]the LORD, who am
[GNSS|0B6D]but dust and ashes.


[GNSS|0B6E]18,28 Peradventure there shall lack
[GNSS|0B6F]five of the fifty righteous;


[GNSS|0B70]wilt Thou destroy all
[GNSS|0B71]the city for lack
[GNSS|0B72]of five?' And He said:
[GNSS|0B73]'I will not destroy it,
[GNSS|0B74]if I find there forty
[GNSS|0B75]and five.' 18,29
[GNSS|0B76]And he spoke unto Him
[GNSS|0B77]yet again, and said: 'Peradventure
[GNSS|0B78]there shall be forty found
[GNSS|0B79]there.' And He said: 'I
[GNSS|0B7A]will not do it
[GNSS|0B7B]for the forty's sake.' 18,30
[GNSS|0B7C]And he said: 'Oh, let
[GNSS|0B7D]not the LORD be angry,
[GNSS|0B7E]and I will speak.


[GNSS|0B7F]Peradventure there shall thirty be
[GNSS|0B80]found there.' And He said:
[GNSS|0B81]'I will not
[GNSS|0B82]do it, if I find
[GNSS|0B83]thirty there.' 18,31
[GNSS|0B84]And he said: 'Behold now,
[GNSS|0B85]I have taken upon me
[GNSS|0B86]to speak unto
[GNSS|0B87]the LORD.


[GNSS|0B88]Peradventure there shall be twenty
[GNSS|0B89]found there.' And He said:
[GNSS|0B8A]'I will not destroy it
[GNSS|0B8B]for the twenty's sake.' 18,32
[GNSS|0B8C]And he said: 'Oh, let
[GNSS|0B8D]not the LORD be angry,
[GNSS|0B8E]and I will speak
[GNSS|0B8F]yet but this once.


[GNSS|0B90]Peradventure ten shall be found
[GNSS|0B91]there.' And He said: 'I
[GNSS|0B92]will not destroy it
[GNSS|0B93]for the ten's sake.' 18,33
[GNSS|0B94]And the LORD
[GNSS|0B95]went His way,
[GNSS|0B96]as soon as He
[GNSS|0B97]had left off
[GNSS|0B98]speaking to Abraham;


[GNSS|0B99]and Abraham returned unto his
[GNSS|0B9A]place.


[GNSS|0B9B]19,1 And the two angels
[GNSS|0B9C]came to Sodom at even;


[GNSS|0B9D]and Lot sat in
[GNSS|0B9E]the gate of Sodom;


[GNSS|0B9F]and Lot saw them,
[GNSS|0BA0]and rose up to meet
[GNSS|0BA1]them;


[GNSS|0BA2]and he fell down on
[GNSS|0BA3]his face to
[GNSS|0BA4]the earth;


[GNSS|0BA5]19,2 and he said: 'Behold
[GNSS|0BA6]now, my lords, turn aside,
[GNSS|0BA7]I pray you, into your
[GNSS|0BA8]servant's house, and tarry all
[GNSS|0BA9]night, and wash your feet,
[GNSS|0BAA]and ye shall rise up
[GNSS|0BAB]early, and go on your
[GNSS|0BAC]way.' And they said: 'Nay;


[GNSS|0BAD]but we will abide in
[GNSS|0BAE]the broad place all night.'
[GNSS|0BAF]19,3 And he
[GNSS|0BB0]urged them greatly;


[GNSS|0BB1]and they turned in unto
[GNSS|0BB2]him, and entered into his
[GNSS|0BB3]house;


[GNSS|0BB4]and he made them
[GNSS|0BB5]a feast, and did bake
[GNSS|0BB6]unleavened bread, and they did
[GNSS|0BB7]eat.


[GNSS|0BB8]19,4 But before they lay
[GNSS|0BB9]down, the men
[GNSS|0BBA]of the city,
[GNSS|0BBB]even the men
[GNSS|0BBC]of Sodom, compassed
[GNSS|0BBD]the house round, both young
[GNSS|0BBE]and old, all
[GNSS|0BBF]the people from every quarter.


[GNSS|0BC0]19,5 And they
[GNSS|0BC1]called unto Lot,
[GNSS|0BC2]and said unto him: 'Where
[GNSS|0BC3]are the men that came
[GNSS|0BC4]in to thee this night?
[GNSS|0BC5]bring them out unto us,
[GNSS|0BC6]that we may know them.'
[GNSS|0BC7]19,6 And Lot
[GNSS|0BC8]went out unto them to
[GNSS|0BC9]the door, and shut
[GNSS|0BCA]the door after him.


[GNSS|0BCB]19,7 And he said: 'I
[GNSS|0BCC]pray you, my brethren,
[GNSS|0BCD]do not so wickedly.


[GNSS|0BCE]19,8 Behold now, I
[GNSS|0BCF]have two daughters that
[GNSS|0BD0]have not known man;


[GNSS|0BD1]let me, I pray you,
[GNSS|0BD2]bring them out unto you,
[GNSS|0BD3]and do ye to them
[GNSS|0BD4]as is good in your
[GNSS|0BD5]eyes;


[GNSS|0BD6]only unto these men
[GNSS|0BD7]do nothing;


[GNSS|0BD8]forasmuch as they are come
[GNSS|0BD9]under the shadow
[GNSS|0BDA]of my roof.' 19,9
[GNSS|0BDB]And they said: 'Stand back.'
[GNSS|0BDC]And they said: 'This one
[GNSS|0BDD]fellow came in to sojourn,
[GNSS|0BDE]and he will needs play
[GNSS|0BDF]the judge;


[GNSS|0BE0]now will we deal worse
[GNSS|0BE1]with thee, than
[GNSS|0BE2]with them.' And they
[GNSS|0BE3]pressed sore upon
[GNSS|0BE4]the man, even Lot,
[GNSS|0BE5]and drew near to break
[GNSS|0BE6]the door.


[GNSS|0BE7]19,10 But the men put
[GNSS|0BE8]forth their hand,
[GNSS|0BE9]and brought Lot into
[GNSS|0BEA]the house to them,
[GNSS|0BEB]and the door they shut.


[GNSS|0BEC]19,11 And they smote
[GNSS|0BED]the men that were at
[GNSS|0BEE]the door of
[GNSS|0BEF]the house with blindness, both
[GNSS|0BF0]small and great;


[GNSS|0BF1]so that they
[GNSS|0BF2]wearied themselves to find
[GNSS|0BF3]the door.


[GNSS|0BF4]19,12 And the men
[GNSS|0BF5]said unto Lot: 'Hast thou
[GNSS|0BF6]here any besides? son-in-law,
[GNSS|0BF7]and thy sons,
[GNSS|0BF8]and thy daughters,
[GNSS|0BF9]and whomsoever thou hast in
[GNSS|0BFA]the city;


[GNSS|0BFB]bring them out
[GNSS|0BFC]of the place;


[GNSS|0BFD]19,13 for we
[GNSS|0BFE]will destroy this place,
[GNSS|0BFF]because the cry
[GNSS|0C00]of them is
[GNSS|0C01]waxed great before
[GNSS|0C02]the LORD;


[GNSS|0C03]and the LORD hath sent
[GNSS|0C04]us to destroy it.' 19,14
[GNSS|0C05]And Lot went out,
[GNSS|0C06]and spoke unto his sons-in-law,
[GNSS|0C07]who married his daughters,
[GNSS|0C08]and said: 'Up,
[GNSS|0C09]get you out
[GNSS|0C0A]of this place;


[GNSS|0C0B]for the LORD
[GNSS|0C0C]will destroy the city.'
[GNSS|0C0D]But he seemed unto his
[GNSS|0C0E]sons-in-law as one that jested.


[GNSS|0C0F]19,15 And when
[GNSS|0C10]the morning arose,
[GNSS|0C11]then the angels
[GNSS|0C12]hastened Lot, saying: 'Arise, take
[GNSS|0C13]thy wife, and thy two
[GNSS|0C14]daughters that are here;


[GNSS|0C15]lest thou be swept away
[GNSS|0C16]in the iniquity
[GNSS|0C17]of the city.' 19,16
[GNSS|0C18]But he lingered;


[GNSS|0C19]and the men laid hold
[GNSS|0C1A]upon his hand,
[GNSS|0C1B]and upon the hand
[GNSS|0C1C]of his wife,
[GNSS|0C1D]and upon the hand
[GNSS|0C1E]of his two daughters;


[GNSS|0C1F]the LORD being merciful unto
[GNSS|0C20]him.


[GNSS|0C21]And they brought him forth,
[GNSS|0C22]and set him
[GNSS|0C23]without the city.


[GNSS|0C24]19,17 And it came to
[GNSS|0C25]pass, when they
[GNSS|0C26]had brought them forth abroad,
[GNSS|0C27]that he said: 'Escape
[GNSS|0C28]for thy life;


[GNSS|0C29]look not behind thee,
[GNSS|0C2A]neither stay thou in all
[GNSS|0C2B]the Plain;


[GNSS|0C2C]escape to the mountain,
[GNSS|0C2D]lest thou be swept away.'
[GNSS|0C2E]19,18 And Lot
[GNSS|0C2F]said unto them: 'Oh,
[GNSS|0C30]not so, my lord;


[GNSS|0C31]19,19 behold now, thy servant
[GNSS|0C32]hath found grace in thy
[GNSS|0C33]sight, and thou hast
[GNSS|0C34]magnified thy mercy,
[GNSS|0C35]which thou hast shown unto
[GNSS|0C36]me in saving my life;


[GNSS|0C37]and I cannot escape to
[GNSS|0C38]the mountain, lest
[GNSS|0C39]the evil overtake me,
[GNSS|0C3A]and I die.


[GNSS|0C3B]19,20 Behold now, this city
[GNSS|0C3C]is near to flee unto,
[GNSS|0C3D]and it is
[GNSS|0C3E]a little one;


[GNSS|0C3F]oh, let me escape thither-is
[GNSS|0C40]it not a little one?-and
[GNSS|0C41]my soul shall live.' 19,21
[GNSS|0C42]And he said unto him:
[GNSS|0C43]'See, I have
[GNSS|0C44]accepted thee concerning this
[GNSS|0C45]thing also, that I
[GNSS|0C46]will not overthrow
[GNSS|0C47]the city of
[GNSS|0C48]which thou hast spoken.


[GNSS|0C49]19,22 Hasten thou, escape thither;


[GNSS|0C4A]for I cannot
[GNSS|0C4B]do any thing
[GNSS|0C4C]till thou be come thither.'-Therefore
[GNSS|0C4D]the name of
[GNSS|0C4E]the city was
[GNSS|0C4F]called Zoar.- 19,23
[GNSS|0C50]The sun was risen upon
[GNSS|0C51]the earth when Lot came
[GNSS|0C52]unto Zoar.


[GNSS|0C53]19,24 Then the LORD
[GNSS|0C54]caused to rain upon Sodom
[GNSS|0C55]and upon Gomorrah brimstone
[GNSS|0C56]and fire from
[GNSS|0C57]the LORD out
[GNSS|0C58]of heaven;


[GNSS|0C59]19,25 and He overthrow those
[GNSS|0C5A]cities, and all
[GNSS|0C5B]the Plain, and all
[GNSS|0C5C]the inhabitants of
[GNSS|0C5D]the cities, and that
[GNSS|0C5E]which grew upon
[GNSS|0C5F]the ground.


[GNSS|0C60]19,26 But his wife
[GNSS|0C61]looked back from behind him,
[GNSS|0C62]and she became
[GNSS|0C63]a pillar of salt.


[GNSS|0C64]19,27 And Abraham
[GNSS|0C65]got up early in
[GNSS|0C66]the morning to
[GNSS|0C67]the place where he
[GNSS|0C68]had stood before
[GNSS|0C69]the LORD.


[GNSS|0C6A]19,28 And he
[GNSS|0C6B]looked out toward Sodom
[GNSS|0C6C]and Gomorrah, and toward all
[GNSS|0C6D]the land of
[GNSS|0C6E]the Plain, and beheld, and,
[GNSS|0C6F]lo, the smoke
[GNSS|0C70]of the land
[GNSS|0C71]went up as
[GNSS|0C72]the smoke of
[GNSS|0C73]a furnace.


[GNSS|0C74]19,29 And it came to
[GNSS|0C75]pass, when God
[GNSS|0C76]destroyed the cities
[GNSS|0C77]of the Plain, that God
[GNSS|0C78]remembered Abraham, and sent Lot
[GNSS|0C79]out of the midst
[GNSS|0C7A]of the overthrow,
[GNSS|0C7B]when He overthrew
[GNSS|0C7C]the cities in
[GNSS|0C7D]which Lot dwelt.


[GNSS|0C7E]19,30 And Lot
[GNSS|0C7F]went up out
[GNSS|0C80]of Zoar, and dwelt in
[GNSS|0C81]the mountain, and his two
[GNSS|0C82]daughters with him;


[GNSS|0C83]for he feared to dwell
[GNSS|0C84]in Zoar;


[GNSS|0C85]and he dwelt in
[GNSS|0C86]a cave, he
[GNSS|0C87]and his two daughters.


[GNSS|0C88]19,31 And the first-born
[GNSS|0C89]said unto the younger: 'Our
[GNSS|0C8A]father is old,
[GNSS|0C8B]and there is
[GNSS|0C8C]not a man in
[GNSS|0C8D]the earth to come in
[GNSS|0C8E]unto us after
[GNSS|0C8F]the manner of all
[GNSS|0C90]the earth.


[GNSS|0C91]19,32 Come, let us
[GNSS|0C92]make our father drink wine,
[GNSS|0C93]and we will lie
[GNSS|0C94]with him, that we may
[GNSS|0C95]preserve seed of our father.'
[GNSS|0C96]19,33 And they
[GNSS|0C97]made their father drink wine
[GNSS|0C98]that night.


[GNSS|0C99]And the first-born
[GNSS|0C9A]went in, and lay
[GNSS|0C9B]with her father;


[GNSS|0C9C]and he knew
[GNSS|0C9D]not when she lay down,
[GNSS|0C9E]nor when she arose.


[GNSS|0C9F]19,34 And it came to
[GNSS|0CA0]pass on the morrow, that
[GNSS|0CA1]the first-born said unto
[GNSS|0CA2]the younger: 'Behold, I lay
[GNSS|0CA3]yesternight with my father.


[GNSS|0CA4]Let us make him drink
[GNSS|0CA5]wine this night also;


[GNSS|0CA6]and go thou in,
[GNSS|0CA7]and lie with him, that
[GNSS|0CA8]we may preserve seed
[GNSS|0CA9]of our father.' 19,35
[GNSS|0CAA]And they made their father
[GNSS|0CAB]drink wine that night also.


[GNSS|0CAC]And the younger arose,
[GNSS|0CAD]and lay with him;


[GNSS|0CAE]and he knew
[GNSS|0CAF]not when she lay down,
[GNSS|0CB0]nor when she arose.


[GNSS|0CB1]19,36 Thus were both
[GNSS|0CB2]the daughters of Lot
[GNSS|0CB3]with child by their father.


[GNSS|0CB4]19,37 And the first-born bore
[GNSS|0CB5]a son, and
[GNSS|0CB6]called his name Moab-the same
[GNSS|0CB7]is the father
[GNSS|0CB8]of the Moabites unto this
[GNSS|0CB9]day.


[GNSS|0CBA]19,38 And the younger, she
[GNSS|0CBB]also bore a son,
[GNSS|0CBC]and called his name Ben-ammi-the
[GNSS|0CBD]same is the father
[GNSS|0CBE]of the children
[GNSS|0CBF]of Ammon unto this day.


[GNSS|0CC0]{S} 20,1 And Abraham
[GNSS|0CC1]journeyed from thence toward
[GNSS|0CC2]the land of
[GNSS|0CC3]the South, and dwelt between
[GNSS|0CC4]Kadesh and Shur;


[GNSS|0CC5]and he sojourned in Gerar.


[GNSS|0CC6]20,2 And Abraham
[GNSS|0CC7]said of Sarah his wife:
[GNSS|0CC8]'She is my sister.'
[GNSS|0CC9]And Abimelech king
[GNSS|0CCA]of Gerar sent,
[GNSS|0CCB]and took Sarah.


[GNSS|0CCC]20,3 But God came to
[GNSS|0CCD]Abimelech in a dream
[GNSS|0CCE]of the night,
[GNSS|0CCF]and said to him: 'Behold,
[GNSS|0CD0]thou shalt die,
[GNSS|0CD1]because of the woman
[GNSS|0CD2]whom thou hast taken;


[GNSS|0CD3]for she is
[GNSS|0CD4]a man's wife.' 20,4
[GNSS|0CD5]Now Abimelech had
[GNSS|0CD6]not come near her;


[GNSS|0CD7]and he said: 'LORD, wilt
[GNSS|0CD8]Thou slay even
[GNSS|0CD9]a righteous nation? 20,5
[GNSS|0CDA]Said he not himself unto
[GNSS|0CDB]me: She is my sister?
[GNSS|0CDC]and she, even she herself
[GNSS|0CDD]said: He is my brother.


[GNSS|0CDE]In the simplicity
[GNSS|0CDF]of my heart
[GNSS|0CE0]and the innocency
[GNSS|0CE1]of my hands
[GNSS|0CE2]have I done this.' 20,6
[GNSS|0CE3]And God said unto him
[GNSS|0CE4]in the dream: 'Yea, I
[GNSS|0CE5]know that in
[GNSS|0CE6]the simplicity of thy heart
[GNSS|0CE7]thou hast done this,
[GNSS|0CE8]and I also withheld thee
[GNSS|0CE9]from sinning against Me.
[GNSS|0CEA]Therefore suffered I thee
[GNSS|0CEB]not to touch her.


[GNSS|0CEC]20,7 Now therefore restore
[GNSS|0CED]the man's wife;


[GNSS|0CEE]for he is
[GNSS|0CEF]a prophet, and he shall
[GNSS|0CF0]pray for thee,
[GNSS|0CF1]and thou shalt live;


[GNSS|0CF2]and if thou restore her
[GNSS|0CF3]not, know thou that thou
[GNSS|0CF4]shalt surely die, thou,
[GNSS|0CF5]and all that are thine.'
[GNSS|0CF6]20,8 And Abimelech rose early
[GNSS|0CF7]in the morning,
[GNSS|0CF8]and called all his servants,
[GNSS|0CF9]and told all these things
[GNSS|0CFA]in their ears;


[GNSS|0CFB]and the men were sore
[GNSS|0CFC]afraid.


[GNSS|0CFD]20,9 Then Abimelech
[GNSS|0CFE]called Abraham, and
[GNSS|0CFF]said unto him: 'What hast
[GNSS|0D00]thou done unto us?
[GNSS|0D01]and wherein have I
[GNSS|0D02]sinned against thee, that thou
[GNSS|0D03]hast brought on me
[GNSS|0D04]and on my kingdom
[GNSS|0D05]a great sin? thou hast
[GNSS|0D06]done deeds unto me that
[GNSS|0D07]ought not to be done.'
[GNSS|0D08]20,10 And Abimelech
[GNSS|0D09]said unto Abraham: 'What sawest
[GNSS|0D0A]thou, that thou hast done
[GNSS|0D0B]this thing?' 20,11
[GNSS|0D0C]And Abraham said: 'Because I
[GNSS|0D0D]thought: Surely the fear
[GNSS|0D0E]of God is
[GNSS|0D0F]not in this place;


[GNSS|0D10]and they will slay me
[GNSS|0D11]for my wife's sake.


[GNSS|0D12]20,12 And moreover she is
[GNSS|0D13]indeed my sister,
[GNSS|0D14]the daughter of my father,
[GNSS|0D15]but not the daughter
[GNSS|0D16]of my mother;


[GNSS|0D17]and so she became my
[GNSS|0D18]wife.


[GNSS|0D19]20,13 And it came to
[GNSS|0D1A]pass, when God
[GNSS|0D1B]caused me to wander from
[GNSS|0D1C]my father's house, that I
[GNSS|0D1D]said unto her: This is
[GNSS|0D1E]thy kindness which thou shalt
[GNSS|0D1F]show unto me; at every
[GNSS|0D20]place whither we shall come,
[GNSS|0D21]say of me: He is
[GNSS|0D22]my brother.' 20,14
[GNSS|0D23]And Abimelech took sheep
[GNSS|0D24]and oxen, and men-servants
[GNSS|0D25]and women-servants, and gave them
[GNSS|0D26]unto Abraham, and
[GNSS|0D27]restored him Sarah his wife.


[GNSS|0D28]20,15 And Abimelech said: 'Behold,
[GNSS|0D29]my land is
[GNSS|0D2A]before thee: dwell
[GNSS|0D2B]where it pleaseth thee.' 20,16
[GNSS|0D2C]And unto Sarah he said:
[GNSS|0D2D]'Behold, I have given thy
[GNSS|0D2E]brother a thousand pieces
[GNSS|0D2F]of silver;


[GNSS|0D30]behold, it is
[GNSS|0D31]for thee a
[GNSS|0D32]covering of the eyes to
[GNSS|0D33]all that are
[GNSS|0D34]with thee;


[GNSS|0D35]and before all men thou
[GNSS|0D36]art righted.' 20,17
[GNSS|0D37]And Abraham prayed unto God;


[GNSS|0D38]and God healed Abimelech,
[GNSS|0D39]and his wife,
[GNSS|0D3A]and his maid-servants;


[GNSS|0D3B]and they bore children.


[GNSS|0D3C]20,18 For the LORD
[GNSS|0D3D]had fast closed up all
[GNSS|0D3E]the wombs of
[GNSS|0D3F]the house of Abimelech,
[GNSS|0D40]because of Sarah Abraham's wife.


[GNSS|0D41]{S} 21,1 And
[GNSS|0D42]the LORD remembered Sarah
[GNSS|0D43]as He had said,
[GNSS|0D44]and the LORD did unto
[GNSS|0D45]Sarah as He
[GNSS|0D46]had spoken.


[GNSS|0D47]21,2 And Sarah conceived,
[GNSS|0D48]and bore Abraham
[GNSS|0D49]a son in his old
[GNSS|0D4A]age, at the set
[GNSS|0D4B]time of which God
[GNSS|0D4C]had spoken to him.


[GNSS|0D4D]21,3 And Abraham
[GNSS|0D4E]called the name
[GNSS|0D4F]of his son that was
[GNSS|0D50]born unto him,
[GNSS|0D51]whom Sarah bore to him,
[GNSS|0D52]Isaac.


[GNSS|0D53]21,4 And Abraham
[GNSS|0D54]circumcised his son Isaac
[GNSS|0D55]when he was eight days
[GNSS|0D56]old, as God
[GNSS|0D57]had commanded him.


[GNSS|0D58]21,5 And Abraham was
[GNSS|0D59]a hundred years old,
[GNSS|0D5A]when his son Isaac was
[GNSS|0D5B]born unto him.


[GNSS|0D5C]21,6 And Sarah said: 'God
[GNSS|0D5D]hath made laughter
[GNSS|0D5E]for me; every one that
[GNSS|0D5F]heareth will laugh on account
[GNSS|0D60]of me.' 21,7
[GNSS|0D61]And she said: 'Who
[GNSS|0D62]would have said unto Abraham,
[GNSS|0D63]that Sarah should give children
[GNSS|0D64]suck? for I
[GNSS|0D65]have borne him
[GNSS|0D66]a son in his old
[GNSS|0D67]age.' 21,8 And
[GNSS|0D68]the child grew,
[GNSS|0D69]and was weaned.


[GNSS|0D6A]And Abraham made
[GNSS|0D6B]a great feast on
[GNSS|0D6C]the day that Isaac was
[GNSS|0D6D]weaned.


[GNSS|0D6E]21,9 And Sarah saw
[GNSS|0D6F]the son of Hagar
[GNSS|0D70]the Egyptian, whom she
[GNSS|0D71]had borne unto Abraham,
[GNSS|0D72]making sport.


[GNSS|0D73]21,10 Wherefore she
[GNSS|0D74]said unto Abraham: 'Cast out
[GNSS|0D75]this bondwoman and her son;


[GNSS|0D76]for the son
[GNSS|0D77]of this bondwoman shall
[GNSS|0D78]not be heir
[GNSS|0D79]with my son,
[GNSS|0D7A]even with Isaac.' 21,11
[GNSS|0D7B]And the thing was very
[GNSS|0D7C]grievous in Abraham's sight on
[GNSS|0D7D]account of his son.


[GNSS|0D7E]21,12 And God
[GNSS|0D7F]said unto Abraham: 'Let it
[GNSS|0D80]not be grievous in thy
[GNSS|0D81]sight because of
[GNSS|0D82]the lad, and
[GNSS|0D83]because of thy bondwoman;


[GNSS|0D84]in all that Sarah saith
[GNSS|0D85]unto thee, hearken unto her
[GNSS|0D86]voice;


[GNSS|0D87]for in Isaac shall seed
[GNSS|0D88]be called to thee.


[GNSS|0D89]21,13 And also
[GNSS|0D8A]of the son
[GNSS|0D8B]of the bondwoman
[GNSS|0D8C]will I make
[GNSS|0D8D]a nation, because he is
[GNSS|0D8E]thy seed.' 21,14
[GNSS|0D8F]And Abraham arose up early
[GNSS|0D90]in the morning,
[GNSS|0D91]and took bread
[GNSS|0D92]and a bottle
[GNSS|0D93]of water, and gave it
[GNSS|0D94]unto Hagar, putting it on
[GNSS|0D95]her shoulder, and
[GNSS|0D96]the child, and sent her
[GNSS|0D97]away;


[GNSS|0D98]and she departed,
[GNSS|0D99]and strayed in
[GNSS|0D9A]the wilderness of Beer-sheba.


[GNSS|0D9B]21,15 And the water in
[GNSS|0D9C]the bottle was spent,
[GNSS|0D9D]and she cast
[GNSS|0D9E]the child under one
[GNSS|0D9F]of the shrubs.


[GNSS|0DA0]21,16 And she went,
[GNSS|0DA1]and sat her down
[GNSS|0DA2]over against him
[GNSS|0DA3]a good way off,
[GNSS|0DA4]as it were
[GNSS|0DA5]a bow-shot;


[GNSS|0DA6]for she said: 'Let me
[GNSS|0DA7]not look upon
[GNSS|0DA8]the death of
[GNSS|0DA9]the child.' And she sat
[GNSS|0DAA]over against him,
[GNSS|0DAB]and lifted up her voice,
[GNSS|0DAC]and wept.


[GNSS|0DAD]21,17 And God heard
[GNSS|0DAE]the voice of
[GNSS|0DAF]the lad;


[GNSS|0DB0]and the angel
[GNSS|0DB1]of God called to Hagar
[GNSS|0DB2]out of heaven,
[GNSS|0DB3]and said unto her: 'What
[GNSS|0DB4]aileth thee, Hagar? fear not;


[GNSS|0DB5]for God hath heard
[GNSS|0DB6]the voice of
[GNSS|0DB7]the lad where he is.
[GNSS|0DB8]21,18 Arise, lift up
[GNSS|0DB9]the lad, and hold him
[GNSS|0DBA]fast by thy hand;


[GNSS|0DBB]for I will
[GNSS|0DBC]make him a great nation.'
[GNSS|0DBD]21,19 And God
[GNSS|0DBE]opened her eyes,
[GNSS|0DBF]and she saw
[GNSS|0DC0]a well of water;


[GNSS|0DC1]and she went,
[GNSS|0DC2]and filled the bottle
[GNSS|0DC3]with water, and gave
[GNSS|0DC4]the lad drink.


[GNSS|0DC5]21,20 And God was
[GNSS|0DC6]with the lad,
[GNSS|0DC7]and he grew;


[GNSS|0DC8]and he dwelt in
[GNSS|0DC9]the wilderness, and became an
[GNSS|0DCA]archer.


[GNSS|0DCB]21,21 And he dwelt in
[GNSS|0DCC]the wilderness of Paran;


[GNSS|0DCD]and his mother took him
[GNSS|0DCE]a wife out
[GNSS|0DCF]of the land
[GNSS|0DD0]of Egypt.


[GNSS|0DD1]{P}  21,22
[GNSS|0DD2]And it came to pass
[GNSS|0DD3]at that time, that Abimelech
[GNSS|0DD4]and Phicol the captain
[GNSS|0DD5]of his host spoke unto
[GNSS|0DD6]Abraham, saying: 'God is
[GNSS|0DD7]with thee in all that
[GNSS|0DD8]thou doest.


[GNSS|0DD9]21,23 Now therefore swear unto
[GNSS|0DDA]me here by God that
[GNSS|0DDB]thou wilt not deal falsely
[GNSS|0DDC]with me, nor
[GNSS|0DDD]with my son,
[GNSS|0DDE]nor with my son's son;


[GNSS|0DDF]but according to
[GNSS|0DE0]the kindness that I
[GNSS|0DE1]have done unto thee, thou
[GNSS|0DE2]shalt do unto me,
[GNSS|0DE3]and to the land
[GNSS|0DE4]wherein thou hast sojourned.' 21,24
[GNSS|0DE5]And Abraham said: 'I
[GNSS|0DE6]will swear.' 21,25
[GNSS|0DE7]And Abraham reproved Abimelech
[GNSS|0DE8]because of the well
[GNSS|0DE9]of water, which Abimelech's servants
[GNSS|0DEA]had violently taken away.


[GNSS|0DEB]21,26 And Abimelech said: 'I
[GNSS|0DEC]know not who hath done
[GNSS|0DED]this thing;


[GNSS|0DEE]neither didst thou tell me,
[GNSS|0DEF]neither yet heard I
[GNSS|0DF0]of it, but to-day.' 21,27
[GNSS|0DF1]And Abraham took sheep
[GNSS|0DF2]and oxen, and gave them
[GNSS|0DF3]unto Abimelech;


[GNSS|0DF4]and they two
[GNSS|0DF5]made a covenant.


[GNSS|0DF6]21,28 And Abraham set seven
[GNSS|0DF7]ewe-lambs of the flock
[GNSS|0DF8]by themselves.


[GNSS|0DF9]21,29 And Abimelech
[GNSS|0DFA]said unto Abraham: 'What mean
[GNSS|0DFB]these seven ewe-lambs
[GNSS|0DFC]which thou hast set
[GNSS|0DFD]by themselves?' 21,30
[GNSS|0DFE]And he said: 'Verily, these
[GNSS|0DFF]seven ewe-lambs shalt thou take
[GNSS|0E00]of my hand, that it
[GNSS|0E01]may be a witness unto
[GNSS|0E02]me, that I
[GNSS|0E03]have digged this well.' 21,31
[GNSS|0E04]Wherefore that place was
[GNSS|0E05]called Beer-sheba;


[GNSS|0E06]because there they swore both
[GNSS|0E07]of them.


[GNSS|0E08]21,32 So they
[GNSS|0E09]made a covenant at Beer-sheba;


[GNSS|0E0A]and Abimelech rose up,
[GNSS|0E0B]and Phicol the captain
[GNSS|0E0C]of his host,
[GNSS|0E0D]and they returned into
[GNSS|0E0E]the land of
[GNSS|0E0F]the Philistines.


[GNSS|0E10]21,33 And Abraham
[GNSS|0E11]planted a tamarisk-tree in Beer-sheba,
[GNSS|0E12]and called there on
[GNSS|0E13]the name of
[GNSS|0E14]the LORD, the
[GNSS|0E15]Everlasting God.


[GNSS|0E16]21,34 And Abraham
[GNSS|0E17]sojourned in the land
[GNSS|0E18]of the Philistines many days.


[GNSS|0E19]{P}  22,1
[GNSS|0E1A]And it came to pass
[GNSS|0E1B]after these things, that God
[GNSS|0E1C]did prove Abraham,
[GNSS|0E1D]and said unto him: 'Abraham';


[GNSS|0E1E]and he said: 'Here am
[GNSS|0E1F]I.' 22,2 And He said:
[GNSS|0E20]'Take now thy son, thine
[GNSS|0E21]only son, whom thou lovest,
[GNSS|0E22]even Isaac, and
[GNSS|0E23]get thee into
[GNSS|0E24]the land of Moriah;


[GNSS|0E25]and offer him there
[GNSS|0E26]for a burnt-offering upon one
[GNSS|0E27]of the mountains
[GNSS|0E28]which I will tell thee
[GNSS|0E29]of.' 22,3 And Abraham rose
[GNSS|0E2A]early in the morning,
[GNSS|0E2B]and saddled his ass,
[GNSS|0E2C]and took two
[GNSS|0E2D]of his young men
[GNSS|0E2E]with him, and Isaac his
[GNSS|0E2F]son;


[GNSS|0E30]and he cleaved
[GNSS|0E31]the wood for
[GNSS|0E32]the burnt-offering, and rose up,
[GNSS|0E33]and went unto
[GNSS|0E34]the place of
[GNSS|0E35]which God had told him.


[GNSS|0E36]22,4 On the third day
[GNSS|0E37]Abraham lifted up his eyes,
[GNSS|0E38]and saw the place afar
[GNSS|0E39]off.


[GNSS|0E3A]22,5 And Abraham
[GNSS|0E3B]said unto his young men:
[GNSS|0E3C]'Abide ye here
[GNSS|0E3D]with the ass,
[GNSS|0E3E]and I and
[GNSS|0E3F]the lad will
[GNSS|0E40]go yonder;


[GNSS|0E41]and we will worship,
[GNSS|0E42]and come back to you.'
[GNSS|0E43]22,6 And Abraham took
[GNSS|0E44]the wood of
[GNSS|0E45]the burnt-offering, and laid it
[GNSS|0E46]upon Isaac his son;


[GNSS|0E47]and he took in his
[GNSS|0E48]hand the fire
[GNSS|0E49]and the knife;


[GNSS|0E4A]and they went both
[GNSS|0E4B]of them together.


[GNSS|0E4C]22,7 And Isaac spoke unto
[GNSS|0E4D]Abraham his father,
[GNSS|0E4E]and said: 'My father.'
[GNSS|0E4F]And he said: 'Here am
[GNSS|0E50]I, my son.'
[GNSS|0E51]And he said: 'Behold
[GNSS|0E52]the fire and
[GNSS|0E53]the wood;


[GNSS|0E54]but where is
[GNSS|0E55]the lamb for
[GNSS|0E56]a burnt-offering?' 22,8
[GNSS|0E57]And Abraham said: 'God
[GNSS|0E58]will provide Himself
[GNSS|0E59]the lamb for
[GNSS|0E5A]a burnt-offering, my son.'
[GNSS|0E5B]So they went both
[GNSS|0E5C]of them together.


[GNSS|0E5D]22,9 And they came to
[GNSS|0E5E]the place which God
[GNSS|0E5F]had told him of;
[GNSS|0E60]and Abraham built
[GNSS|0E61]the altar there,
[GNSS|0E62]and laid the wood in
[GNSS|0E63]order, and bound Isaac his
[GNSS|0E64]son, and laid him on
[GNSS|0E65]the altar, upon
[GNSS|0E66]the wood.


[GNSS|0E67]22,10 And Abraham
[GNSS|0E68]stretched forth his hand,
[GNSS|0E69]and took the knife to
[GNSS|0E6A]slay his son.


[GNSS|0E6B]22,11 And the angel
[GNSS|0E6C]of the LORD
[GNSS|0E6D]called unto him out
[GNSS|0E6E]of heaven, and said: 'Abraham,
[GNSS|0E6F]Abraham.' And he said: 'Here
[GNSS|0E70]am I.' 22,12
[GNSS|0E71]And he said: 'Lay
[GNSS|0E72]not thy hand upon
[GNSS|0E73]the lad, neither
[GNSS|0E74]do thou any
[GNSS|0E75]thing unto him;


[GNSS|0E76]for now I know that
[GNSS|0E77]thou art a
[GNSS|0E78]God-fearing man, seeing thou hast
[GNSS|0E79]not withheld thy son, thine
[GNSS|0E7A]only son, from Me.' 22,13
[GNSS|0E7B]And Abraham lifted up his
[GNSS|0E7C]eyes, and looked,
[GNSS|0E7D]and behold behind him
[GNSS|0E7E]a ram caught in
[GNSS|0E7F]the thicket by his horns.


[GNSS|0E80]And Abraham went
[GNSS|0E81]and took the ram,
[GNSS|0E82]and offered him up
[GNSS|0E83]for a burnt-offering in
[GNSS|0E84]the stead of his son.


[GNSS|0E85]22,14 And Abraham
[GNSS|0E86]called the name
[GNSS|0E87]of that place Adonai-jireh;


[GNSS|0E88]as it is
[GNSS|0E89]said to this day: 'In
[GNSS|0E8A]the mount where
[GNSS|0E8B]the LORD is seen.' 22,15
[GNSS|0E8C]And the angel
[GNSS|0E8D]of the LORD
[GNSS|0E8E]called unto Abraham
[GNSS|0E8F]a second time out
[GNSS|0E90]of heaven, 22,16
[GNSS|0E91]and said: 'By Myself
[GNSS|0E92]have I sworn, saith
[GNSS|0E93]the LORD, because thou hast
[GNSS|0E94]done this thing,
[GNSS|0E95]and hast not withheld thy
[GNSS|0E96]son, thine only son, 22,17
[GNSS|0E97]that in blessing I
[GNSS|0E98]will bless thee,
[GNSS|0E99]and in multiplying I
[GNSS|0E9A]will multiply thy seed
[GNSS|0E9B]as the stars
[GNSS|0E9C]of the heaven,
[GNSS|0E9D]and as the sand
[GNSS|0E9E]which is upon
[GNSS|0E9F]the seashore;


[GNSS|0EA0]and thy seed shall possess
[GNSS|0EA1]the gate of his enemies;


[GNSS|0EA2]22,18 and in thy seed
[GNSS|0EA3]shall all the nations
[GNSS|0EA4]of the earth be blessed;


[GNSS|0EA5]because thou hast
[GNSS|0EA6]hearkened to My voice.' 22,19
[GNSS|0EA7]So Abraham returned unto his
[GNSS|0EA8]young men, and they rose
[GNSS|0EA9]up and went together to
[GNSS|0EAA]Beer-sheba;


[GNSS|0EAB]and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.


[GNSS|0EAC]{P}  22,20
[GNSS|0EAD]And it came to pass
[GNSS|0EAE]after these things, that it
[GNSS|0EAF]was told Abraham, saying: 'Behold,
[GNSS|0EB0]Milcah, she also hath borne
[GNSS|0EB1]children unto thy brother Nahor:
[GNSS|0EB2]22,21 Uz his first-born,
[GNSS|0EB3]and Buz his brother,
[GNSS|0EB4]and Kemuel the father
[GNSS|0EB5]of Aram;


[GNSS|0EB6]22,22 and Chesed,
[GNSS|0EB7]and Hazo, and Pildash,
[GNSS|0EB8]and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.' 22,23
[GNSS|0EB9]And Bethuel begot Rebekah;


[GNSS|0EBA]these eight did Milcah bear
[GNSS|0EBB]to Nahor, Abraham's brother.


[GNSS|0EBC]22,24 And his concubine,
[GNSS|0EBD]whose name was Reumah, she
[GNSS|0EBE]also bore Tebah,
[GNSS|0EBF]and Gaham, and Tahash,
[GNSS|0EC0]and Maacah.


[GNSS|0EC1]{P}  23,1
[GNSS|0EC2]And the life
[GNSS|0EC3]of Sarah was
[GNSS|0EC4]a hundred and seven
[GNSS|0EC5]and twenty years;


[GNSS|0EC6]these were the years
[GNSS|0EC7]of the life
[GNSS|0EC8]of Sarah.


[GNSS|0EC9]23,2 And Sarah died in
[GNSS|0ECA]Kiriatharba-the same is Hebron-in
[GNSS|0ECB]the land of Canaan;


[GNSS|0ECC]and Abraham came to mourn
[GNSS|0ECD]for Sarah, and to weep
[GNSS|0ECE]for her.


[GNSS|0ECF]23,3 And Abraham rose up
[GNSS|0ED0]from before his dead,
[GNSS|0ED1]and spoke unto
[GNSS|0ED2]the children of Heth, saying:
[GNSS|0ED3]23,4 'I am
[GNSS|0ED4]a stranger and
[GNSS|0ED5]a sojourner with you: give
[GNSS|0ED6]me a possession
[GNSS|0ED7]of a burying-place
[GNSS|0ED8]with you, that I may
[GNSS|0ED9]bury my dead out
[GNSS|0EDA]of my sight.' 23,5
[GNSS|0EDB]And the children
[GNSS|0EDC]of Heth answered Abraham,
[GNSS|0EDD]saying unto him: 23,6 'Hear
[GNSS|0EDE]us, my lord: thou art
[GNSS|0EDF]a mighty prince among us;
[GNSS|0EE0]in the choice
[GNSS|0EE1]of our sepulchres bury thy
[GNSS|0EE2]dead;


[GNSS|0EE3]none of us shall withhold
[GNSS|0EE4]from thee his sepulchre,
[GNSS|0EE5]but that thou mayest bury
[GNSS|0EE6]thy dead.' 23,7
[GNSS|0EE7]And Abraham rose up,
[GNSS|0EE8]and bowed down to
[GNSS|0EE9]the people of
[GNSS|0EEA]the land, even to
[GNSS|0EEB]the children of Heth.


[GNSS|0EEC]23,8 And he spoke
[GNSS|0EED]with them, saying: 'If it
[GNSS|0EEE]be your mind that I
[GNSS|0EEF]should bury my dead out
[GNSS|0EF0]of my sight, hear me,
[GNSS|0EF1]and entreat for me to
[GNSS|0EF2]Ephron the son
[GNSS|0EF3]of Zohar, 23,9 that he
[GNSS|0EF4]may give me
[GNSS|0EF5]the cave of Machpelah,
[GNSS|0EF6]which he hath,
[GNSS|0EF7]which is in
[GNSS|0EF8]the end of his field;


[GNSS|0EF9]for the full price let
[GNSS|0EFA]him give it to me
[GNSS|0EFB]in the midst
[GNSS|0EFC]of you for
[GNSS|0EFD]a possession of
[GNSS|0EFE]a burying-place.' 23,10
[GNSS|0EFF]Now Ephron was
[GNSS|0F00]sitting in the midst
[GNSS|0F01]of the children
[GNSS|0F02]of Heth;


[GNSS|0F03]and Ephron the Hittite
[GNSS|0F04]answered Abraham in
[GNSS|0F05]the hearing of
[GNSS|0F06]the children of Heth,
[GNSS|0F07]even of all that
[GNSS|0F08]went in at
[GNSS|0F09]the gate of his city,
[GNSS|0F0A]saying: 23,11 'Nay, my lord,
[GNSS|0F0B]hear me: the field give
[GNSS|0F0C]I thee, and
[GNSS|0F0D]the cave that is therein,
[GNSS|0F0E]I give it thee;


[GNSS|0F0F]in the presence
[GNSS|0F10]of the sons
[GNSS|0F11]of my people give I
[GNSS|0F12]it thee;


[GNSS|0F13]bury thy dead.' 23,12
[GNSS|0F14]And Abraham bowed down
[GNSS|0F15]before the people
[GNSS|0F16]of the land.


[GNSS|0F17]23,13 And he spoke unto
[GNSS|0F18]Ephron in the
[GNSS|0F19]hearing of the people
[GNSS|0F1A]of the land, saying: 'But
[GNSS|0F1B]if thou wilt, I pray
[GNSS|0F1C]thee, hear me: I
[GNSS|0F1D]will give the price
[GNSS|0F1E]of the field;


[GNSS|0F1F]take it of me,
[GNSS|0F20]and I will bury my
[GNSS|0F21]dead there.' 23,14
[GNSS|0F22]And Ephron answered Abraham,
[GNSS|0F23]saying unto him: 23,15 'My
[GNSS|0F24]lord, hearken unto me:
[GNSS|0F25]a piece of land worth
[GNSS|0F26]four hundred shekels
[GNSS|0F27]of silver, what is that
[GNSS|0F28]betwixt me and thee? bury
[GNSS|0F29]therefore thy dead.' 23,16
[GNSS|0F2A]And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron;


[GNSS|0F2B]and Abraham weighed to Ephron
[GNSS|0F2C]the silver, which he
[GNSS|0F2D]had named in
[GNSS|0F2E]the hearing of
[GNSS|0F2F]the children of Heth, four
[GNSS|0F30]hundred shekels of silver, current
[GNSS|0F31]money with the merchant.


[GNSS|0F32]23,17 So the field
[GNSS|0F33]of Ephron, which was in
[GNSS|0F34]Machpelah, which was
[GNSS|0F35]before Mamre, the field,
[GNSS|0F36]and the cave
[GNSS|0F37]which was therein,
[GNSS|0F38]and all the trees that
[GNSS|0F39]were in the field, that
[GNSS|0F3A]were in all
[GNSS|0F3B]the border thereof round about,
[GNSS|0F3C]were made sure 23,18 unto
[GNSS|0F3D]Abraham for a possession in
[GNSS|0F3E]the presence of
[GNSS|0F3F]the children of Heth,
[GNSS|0F40]before all that
[GNSS|0F41]went in at
[GNSS|0F42]the gate of his city.


[GNSS|0F43]23,19 And after this, Abraham
[GNSS|0F44]buried Sarah his wife in
[GNSS|0F45]the cave of
[GNSS|0F46]the field of Machpelah
[GNSS|0F47]before Mamre-the same is Hebron-in
[GNSS|0F48]the land of Canaan.


[GNSS|0F49]23,20 And the field,
[GNSS|0F4A]and the cave that is
[GNSS|0F4B]therein, were made sure unto
[GNSS|0F4C]Abraham for a possession
[GNSS|0F4D]of a burying-place
[GNSS|0F4E]by the children
[GNSS|0F4F]of Heth.


[GNSS|0F50]{S} 24,1 And Abraham was
[GNSS|0F51]old, well stricken in age;


[GNSS|0F52]and the LORD
[GNSS|0F53]had blessed Abraham in all
[GNSS|0F54]things.


[GNSS|0F55]24,2 And Abraham
[GNSS|0F56]said unto his servant,
[GNSS|0F57]the elder of his house,
[GNSS|0F58]that ruled over all that
[GNSS|0F59]he had: 'Put, I pray
[GNSS|0F5A]thee, thy hand under my
[GNSS|0F5B]thigh.


[GNSS|0F5C]24,3 And I
[GNSS|0F5D]will make thee swear
[GNSS|0F5E]by the LORD,
[GNSS|0F5F]the God of heaven
[GNSS|0F60]and the God
[GNSS|0F61]of the earth, that thou
[GNSS|0F62]shalt not take
[GNSS|0F63]a wife for my son
[GNSS|0F64]of the daughters
[GNSS|0F65]of the Canaanites, among
[GNSS|0F66]whom I dwell.


[GNSS|0F67]24,4 But thou shalt
[GNSS|0F68]go unto my country,
[GNSS|0F69]and to my kindred,
[GNSS|0F6A]and take a wife
[GNSS|0F6B]for my son,
[GNSS|0F6C]even for Isaac.' 24,5
[GNSS|0F6D]And the servant
[GNSS|0F6E]said unto him: 'Peradventure
[GNSS|0F6F]the woman will
[GNSS|0F70]not be willing to follow
[GNSS|0F71]me unto this land;


[GNSS|0F72]must I needs
[GNSS|0F73]bring thy son back unto
[GNSS|0F74]the land from whence thou
[GNSS|0F75]camest?' 24,6 And Abraham
[GNSS|0F76]said unto him: 'Beware thou
[GNSS|0F77]that thou bring
[GNSS|0F78]not my son back thither.


[GNSS|0F79]24,7 The LORD,
[GNSS|0F7A]the God of heaven,
[GNSS|0F7B]who took me from my
[GNSS|0F7C]father's house, and from
[GNSS|0F7D]the land of my nativity,
[GNSS|0F7E]and who spoke unto me,
[GNSS|0F7F]and who swore unto me,
[GNSS|0F80]saying: Unto thy seed
[GNSS|0F81]will I give this land;


[GNSS|0F82]He will send His angel
[GNSS|0F83]before thee, and thou shalt
[GNSS|0F84]take a wife
[GNSS|0F85]for my son from thence.


[GNSS|0F86]24,8 And if
[GNSS|0F87]the woman be
[GNSS|0F88]not willing to follow thee,
[GNSS|0F89]then thou shalt be clear
[GNSS|0F8A]from this my oath;


[GNSS|0F8B]only thou shalt
[GNSS|0F8C]not bring my son back
[GNSS|0F8D]thither.' 24,9 And
[GNSS|0F8E]the servant put his hand
[GNSS|0F8F]under the thigh
[GNSS|0F90]of Abraham his master,
[GNSS|0F91]and swore to him
[GNSS|0F92]concerning this matter.


[GNSS|0F93]24,10 And the servant took
[GNSS|0F94]ten camels, of
[GNSS|0F95]the camels of his master,
[GNSS|0F96]and departed;


[GNSS|0F97]having all goodly things
[GNSS|0F98]of his master's in his
[GNSS|0F99]hand;


[GNSS|0F9A]and he arose,
[GNSS|0F9B]and went to Aram-naharaim, unto
[GNSS|0F9C]the city of Nahor.


[GNSS|0F9D]24,11 And he
[GNSS|0F9E]made the camels to kneel
[GNSS|0F9F]down without the city
[GNSS|0FA0]by the well
[GNSS|0FA1]of water at
[GNSS|0FA2]the time of evening,
[GNSS|0FA3]the time that women
[GNSS|0FA4]go out to draw water.


[GNSS|0FA5]24,12 And he said: 'O
[GNSS|0FA6]LORD, the God
[GNSS|0FA7]of my master Abraham, send
[GNSS|0FA8]me, I pray Thee, good
[GNSS|0FA9]speed this day,
[GNSS|0FAA]and show kindness unto my
[GNSS|0FAB]master Abraham.


[GNSS|0FAC]24,13 Behold, I stand
[GNSS|0FAD]by the fountain
[GNSS|0FAE]of water;


[GNSS|0FAF]and the daughters
[GNSS|0FB0]of the men
[GNSS|0FB1]of the city come out
[GNSS|0FB2]to draw water.


[GNSS|0FB3]24,14 So let it come
[GNSS|0FB4]to pass, that
[GNSS|0FB5]the damsel to
[GNSS|0FB6]whom I shall say: Let
[GNSS|0FB7]down thy pitcher, I pray
[GNSS|0FB8]thee, that I may drink;


[GNSS|0FB9]and she shall say: Drink,
[GNSS|0FBA]and I will give thy
[GNSS|0FBB]camels drink also;


[GNSS|0FBC]let the same be she
[GNSS|0FBD]that Thou hast
[GNSS|0FBE]appointed for Thy servant,
[GNSS|0FBF]even for Isaac;


[GNSS|0FC0]and thereby shall I know
[GNSS|0FC1]that Thou hast shown kindness
[GNSS|0FC2]unto my master.' 24,15
[GNSS|0FC3]And it came to pass,
[GNSS|0FC4]before he had done speaking,
[GNSS|0FC5]that, behold, Rebekah came out,
[GNSS|0FC6]who was born to Bethuel
[GNSS|0FC7]the son of Milcah,
[GNSS|0FC8]the wife of Nahor, Abraham's
[GNSS|0FC9]brother, with her pitcher upon
[GNSS|0FCA]her shoulder.


[GNSS|0FCB]24,16 And the damsel was
[GNSS|0FCC]very fair to look upon,
[GNSS|0FCD]a virgin, neither
[GNSS|0FCE]had any man known her;


[GNSS|0FCF]and she went down to
[GNSS|0FD0]the fountain, and
[GNSS|0FD1]filled her pitcher,
[GNSS|0FD2]and came up. 24,17
[GNSS|0FD3]And the servant ran to
[GNSS|0FD4]meet her, and said: 'Give
[GNSS|0FD5]me to drink, I pray
[GNSS|0FD6]thee, a little water
[GNSS|0FD7]of thy pitcher.' 24,18
[GNSS|0FD8]And she said: 'Drink, my
[GNSS|0FD9]lord';


[GNSS|0FDA]and she hastened,
[GNSS|0FDB]and let down her pitcher
[GNSS|0FDC]upon her hand,
[GNSS|0FDD]and gave him drink.


[GNSS|0FDE]24,19 And when she
[GNSS|0FDF]had done giving him drink,
[GNSS|0FE0]she said: 'I
[GNSS|0FE1]will draw for thy camels
[GNSS|0FE2]also, until they
[GNSS|0FE3]have done drinking.' 24,20
[GNSS|0FE4]And she hastened,
[GNSS|0FE5]and emptied her pitcher into
[GNSS|0FE6]the trough, and ran
[GNSS|0FE7]again unto the well to
[GNSS|0FE8]draw, and drew
[GNSS|0FE9]for all his camels.


[GNSS|0FEA]24,21 And the man
[GNSS|0FEB]looked stedfastly on her;


[GNSS|0FEC]holding his peace, to know
[GNSS|0FED]whether the LORD
[GNSS|0FEE]had made his journey prosperous
[GNSS|0FEF]or not.


[GNSS|0FF0]24,22 And it came to
[GNSS|0FF1]pass, as the camels
[GNSS|0FF2]had done drinking, that
[GNSS|0FF3]the man took
[GNSS|0FF4]a golden ring
[GNSS|0FF5]of half a shekel weight,
[GNSS|0FF6]and two bracelets
[GNSS|0FF7]for her hands
[GNSS|0FF8]of ten shekels weight
[GNSS|0FF9]of gold;


[GNSS|0FFA]24,23 and said: 'Whose daughter
[GNSS|0FFB]art thou? tell me, I
[GNSS|0FFC]pray thee.


[GNSS|0FFD]Is there room in thy
[GNSS|0FFE]father's house for us to
[GNSS|0FFF]lodge in?' 24,24
[GNSS|1000]And she said unto him:
[GNSS|1001]'I am the daughter
[GNSS|1002]of Bethuel the son
[GNSS|1003]of Milcah, whom she bore
[GNSS|1004]unto Nahor.' 24,25 She
[GNSS|1005]said moreover unto him: 'We
[GNSS|1006]have both straw
[GNSS|1007]and provender enough,
[GNSS|1008]and room to lodge in.'
[GNSS|1009]24,26 And the man
[GNSS|100A]bowed his head,
[GNSS|100B]and prostrated himself
[GNSS|100C]before the LORD.


[GNSS|100D]24,27 And he said:
[GNSS|100E]'Blessed be the LORD,
[GNSS|100F]the God of my master
[GNSS|1010]Abraham, who hath
[GNSS|1011]not forsaken His mercy
[GNSS|1012]and His truth toward my
[GNSS|1013]master;


[GNSS|1014]as for me,
[GNSS|1015]the LORD hath led me
[GNSS|1016]in the way to
[GNSS|1017]the house of my master's
[GNSS|1018]brethren.' 24,28 And
[GNSS|1019]the damsel ran,
[GNSS|101A]and told her mother's house
[GNSS|101B]according to these words.


[GNSS|101C]24,29 And Rebekah
[GNSS|101D]had a brother,
[GNSS|101E]and his name was Laban;


[GNSS|101F]and Laban ran out unto
[GNSS|1020]the man, unto
[GNSS|1021]the fountain.


[GNSS|1022]24,30 And it came to
[GNSS|1023]pass, when he saw
[GNSS|1024]the ring, and
[GNSS|1025]the bracelets upon his sister's
[GNSS|1026]hands, and when he heard
[GNSS|1027]the words of Rebekah his
[GNSS|1028]sister, saying: 'Thus spoke
[GNSS|1029]the man unto me,' that
[GNSS|102A]he came unto
[GNSS|102B]the man;


[GNSS|102C]and, behold, he stood
[GNSS|102D]by the camels at
[GNSS|102E]the fountain.


[GNSS|102F]24,31 And he said: 'Come
[GNSS|1030]in, thou blessed
[GNSS|1031]of the LORD;


[GNSS|1032]wherefore standest thou without?
[GNSS|1033]for I have
[GNSS|1034]cleared the house,
[GNSS|1035]and made room
[GNSS|1036]for the camels.' 24,32
[GNSS|1037]And the man came into
[GNSS|1038]the house, and he
[GNSS|1039]ungirded the camels;


[GNSS|103A]and he gave straw
[GNSS|103B]and provender for
[GNSS|103C]the camels, and water to
[GNSS|103D]wash his feet
[GNSS|103E]and the feet
[GNSS|103F]of the men that were
[GNSS|1040]with him.


[GNSS|1041]24,33 And there was set
[GNSS|1042]food before him to eat;


[GNSS|1043]but he said: 'I
[GNSS|1044]will not eat,
[GNSS|1045]until I have told mine
[GNSS|1046]errand.' And he said: 'Speak
[GNSS|1047]on.' 24,34 And he said:
[GNSS|1048]'I am Abraham's servant.


[GNSS|1049]24,35 And the LORD hath
[GNSS|104A]blessed my master greatly;


[GNSS|104B]and he is become great;


[GNSS|104C]and He hath given him
[GNSS|104D]flocks and herds,
[GNSS|104E]and silver and gold,
[GNSS|104F]and men-servants and maid-servants,
[GNSS|1050]and camels and asses.


[GNSS|1051]24,36 And Sarah my master's
[GNSS|1052]wife bore a son to
[GNSS|1053]my master when she was
[GNSS|1054]old;


[GNSS|1055]and unto him hath he
[GNSS|1056]given all that he hath.


[GNSS|1057]24,37 And my master
[GNSS|1058]made me swear, saying: Thou
[GNSS|1059]shalt not take
[GNSS|105A]a wife for my son
[GNSS|105B]of the daughters
[GNSS|105C]of the Canaanites, in
[GNSS|105D]whose land I dwell.


[GNSS|105E]24,38 But thou shalt
[GNSS|105F]go unto my father's house,
[GNSS|1060]and to my kindred,
[GNSS|1061]and take a wife
[GNSS|1062]for my son.


[GNSS|1063]24,39 And I
[GNSS|1064]said unto my master: Peradventure
[GNSS|1065]the woman will
[GNSS|1066]not follow me. 24,40
[GNSS|1067]And he said unto me:
[GNSS|1068]The LORD, before
[GNSS|1069]whom I walk,
[GNSS|106A]will send His angel
[GNSS|106B]with thee, and prosper thy
[GNSS|106C]way;


[GNSS|106D]and thou shalt take
[GNSS|106E]a wife for my son
[GNSS|106F]of my kindred,
[GNSS|1070]and of my father's house;


[GNSS|1071]24,41 then shalt thou be
[GNSS|1072]clear from my oath,
[GNSS|1073]when thou comest to my
[GNSS|1074]kindred;


[GNSS|1075]and if they give her
[GNSS|1076]not to thee, thou shalt
[GNSS|1077]be clear from my oath.


[GNSS|1078]24,42 And I came this
[GNSS|1079]day unto the fountain,
[GNSS|107A]and said: O LORD,
[GNSS|107B]the God of my master
[GNSS|107C]Abraham, if now Thou
[GNSS|107D]do prosper my way
[GNSS|107E]which I go: 24,43 behold,
[GNSS|107F]I stand by
[GNSS|1080]the fountain of water;


[GNSS|1081]and let it come to
[GNSS|1082]pass, that the maiden that
[GNSS|1083]cometh forth to draw, to
[GNSS|1084]whom I shall say: Give
[GNSS|1085]me, I pray thee,
[GNSS|1086]a little water from thy
[GNSS|1087]pitcher to drink;


[GNSS|1088]24,44 and she shall
[GNSS|1089]say to me: Both drink
[GNSS|108A]thou, and I
[GNSS|108B]will also draw
[GNSS|108C]for thy camels;


[GNSS|108D]let the same be
[GNSS|108E]the woman whom
[GNSS|108F]the LORD hath
[GNSS|1090]appointed for my master's son.


[GNSS|1091]24,45 And before I
[GNSS|1092]had done speaking to my
[GNSS|1093]heart, behold, Rebekah came forth
[GNSS|1094]with her pitcher on her
[GNSS|1095]shoulder;


[GNSS|1096]and she went down unto
[GNSS|1097]the fountain, and drew.


[GNSS|1098]And I said unto her:
[GNSS|1099]Let me drink, I pray
[GNSS|109A]thee.


[GNSS|109B]24,46 And she
[GNSS|109C]made haste, and let down
[GNSS|109D]her pitcher from her shoulder,
[GNSS|109E]and said: Drink,
[GNSS|109F]and I will give thy
[GNSS|10A0]camels drink also.


[GNSS|10A1]So I drank,
[GNSS|10A2]and she made
[GNSS|10A3]the camels drink also.


[GNSS|10A4]24,47 And I
[GNSS|10A5]asked her, and said:
[GNSS|10A6]Whose daughter art thou?
[GNSS|10A7]And she said:
[GNSS|10A8]The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's
[GNSS|10A9]son, whom Milcah bore unto
[GNSS|10AA]him.


[GNSS|10AB]And I put
[GNSS|10AC]the ring upon her nose,
[GNSS|10AD]and the bracelets upon her
[GNSS|10AE]hands.


[GNSS|10AF]24,48 And I
[GNSS|10B0]bowed my head,
[GNSS|10B1]and prostrated myself
[GNSS|10B2]before the LORD,
[GNSS|10B3]and blessed the LORD,
[GNSS|10B4]the God of my master
[GNSS|10B5]Abraham, who had led me
[GNSS|10B6]in the right way to
[GNSS|10B7]take my master's brother's daughter
[GNSS|10B8]for his son.


[GNSS|10B9]24,49 And now
[GNSS|10BA]if ye will deal kindly
[GNSS|10BB]and truly with my master,
[GNSS|10BC]tell me; and
[GNSS|10BD]if not, tell me; that
[GNSS|10BE]I may turn to
[GNSS|10BF]the right hand,
[GNSS|10C0]or to the left.' 24,50
[GNSS|10C1]Then Laban and Bethuel
[GNSS|10C2]answered and said: 'The
[GNSS|10C3]thing proceedeth from
[GNSS|10C4]the LORD;


[GNSS|10C5]we cannot speak unto thee
[GNSS|10C6]bad or good.


[GNSS|10C7]24,51 Behold, Rebekah is
[GNSS|10C8]before thee, take her,
[GNSS|10C9]and go, and let her
[GNSS|10CA]be thy master's son's wife,
[GNSS|10CB]as the LORD hath spoken.'
[GNSS|10CC]24,52 And it came to
[GNSS|10CD]pass, that, when Abraham's servant
[GNSS|10CE]heard their words, he
[GNSS|10CF]bowed himself down to
[GNSS|10D0]the earth unto
[GNSS|10D1]the LORD.


[GNSS|10D2]24,53 And the servant brought
[GNSS|10D3]forth jewels of silver,
[GNSS|10D4]and jewels of gold,
[GNSS|10D5]and raiment, and gave them
[GNSS|10D6]to Rebekah;


[GNSS|10D7]he gave also to her
[GNSS|10D8]brother and to her mother
[GNSS|10D9]precious things.


[GNSS|10DA]24,54 And they did eat
[GNSS|10DB]and drink, he
[GNSS|10DC]and the men that were
[GNSS|10DD]with him, and
[GNSS|10DE]tarried all night;


[GNSS|10DF]and they rose up in
[GNSS|10E0]the morning, and he said:
[GNSS|10E1]'Send me away unto my
[GNSS|10E2]master.' 24,55 And her brother
[GNSS|10E3]and her mother said: 'Let
[GNSS|10E4]the damsel abide
[GNSS|10E5]with us a
[GNSS|10E6]few days, at
[GNSS|10E7]the least ten;


[GNSS|10E8]after that she shall go.'
[GNSS|10E9]24,56 And he
[GNSS|10EA]said unto them: 'Delay me
[GNSS|10EB]not, seeing the LORD hath
[GNSS|10EC]prospered my way;


[GNSS|10ED]send me away that I
[GNSS|10EE]may go to my master.'
[GNSS|10EF]24,57 And they said: 'We
[GNSS|10F0]will call the damsel,
[GNSS|10F1]and inquire at her mouth.'
[GNSS|10F2]24,58 And they
[GNSS|10F3]called Rebekah, and
[GNSS|10F4]said unto her: 'Wilt thou
[GNSS|10F5]go with this man?'
[GNSS|10F6]And she said: 'I
[GNSS|10F7]will go.' 24,59
[GNSS|10F8]And they sent away Rebekah
[GNSS|10F9]their sister, and her nurse,
[GNSS|10FA]and Abraham's servant,
[GNSS|10FB]and his men.


[GNSS|10FC]24,60 And they
[GNSS|10FD]blessed Rebekah, and
[GNSS|10FE]said unto her: 'Our sister,
[GNSS|10FF]be thou the mother
[GNSS|1100]of thousands of ten thousands,
[GNSS|1101]and let thy seed possess
[GNSS|1102]the gate of those that
[GNSS|1103]hate them.' 24,61
[GNSS|1104]And Rebekah arose,
[GNSS|1105]and her damsels,
[GNSS|1106]and they rode upon
[GNSS|1107]the camels, and
[GNSS|1108]followed the man.


[GNSS|1109]And the servant took Rebekah,
[GNSS|110A]and went his way.


[GNSS|110B]24,62 And Isaac came from
[GNSS|110C]the way of Beer-lahai-roi;


[GNSS|110D]for he dwelt in
[GNSS|110E]the land of
[GNSS|110F]the South.


[GNSS|1110]24,63 And Isaac
[GNSS|1111]went out to meditate in
[GNSS|1112]the field at
[GNSS|1113]the eventide;


[GNSS|1114]and he lifted up his
[GNSS|1115]eyes, and saw, and, behold,
[GNSS|1116]there were camels coming.


[GNSS|1117]24,64 And Rebekah
[GNSS|1118]lifted up her eyes,
[GNSS|1119]and when she saw Isaac,
[GNSS|111A]she alighted from
[GNSS|111B]the camel.


[GNSS|111C]24,65 And she
[GNSS|111D]said unto the servant: 'What
[GNSS|111E]man is this that walketh
[GNSS|111F]in the field to meet
[GNSS|1120]us?' And the servant said:
[GNSS|1121]'It is my master.'
[GNSS|1122]And she took her veil,
[GNSS|1123]and covered herself.


[GNSS|1124]24,66 And the servant told
[GNSS|1125]Isaac all the things that
[GNSS|1126]he had done.


[GNSS|1127]24,67 And Isaac brought her
[GNSS|1128]into his mother Sarah's tent,
[GNSS|1129]and took Rebekah,
[GNSS|112A]and she became his wife;


[GNSS|112B]and he loved her.


[GNSS|112C]And Isaac was
[GNSS|112D]comforted for his mother.


[GNSS|112E]{P}  25,1
[GNSS|112F]And Abraham took another wife,
[GNSS|1130]and her name was Keturah.


[GNSS|1131]25,2 And she bore him
[GNSS|1132]Zimran, and Jokshan,
[GNSS|1133]and Medan, and Midian,
[GNSS|1134]and Ishbak, and Shuah.


[GNSS|1135]25,3 And Jokshan begot Sheba,
[GNSS|1136]and Dedan.


[GNSS|1137]And the sons
[GNSS|1138]of Dedan were Asshurim,
[GNSS|1139]and Letushim, and Leummim.


[GNSS|113A]25,4 And the sons
[GNSS|113B]of Midian: Ephah,
[GNSS|113C]and Epher, and Hanoch,
[GNSS|113D]and Abida, and Eldaah.


[GNSS|113E]All these were
[GNSS|113F]the children of Keturah.


[GNSS|1140]25,5 And Abraham gave all
[GNSS|1141]that he had unto Isaac.


[GNSS|1142]25,6 But unto
[GNSS|1143]the sons of
[GNSS|1144]the concubines, that Abraham had,
[GNSS|1145]Abraham gave gifts;


[GNSS|1146]and he sent them away
[GNSS|1147]from Isaac his son,
[GNSS|1148]while he yet lived, eastward,
[GNSS|1149]unto the east country.


[GNSS|114A]25,7 And these are
[GNSS|114B]the days of
[GNSS|114C]the years of Abraham's life
[GNSS|114D]which he lived,
[GNSS|114E]a hundred threescore
[GNSS|114F]and fifteen years.


[GNSS|1150]25,8 And Abraham expired,
[GNSS|1151]and died in
[GNSS|1152]a good old age, an
[GNSS|1153]old man, and full
[GNSS|1154]of years;


[GNSS|1155]and was gathered to his
[GNSS|1156]people.


[GNSS|1157]25,9 And Isaac
[GNSS|1158]and Ishmael his sons
[GNSS|1159]buried him in
[GNSS|115A]the cave of Machpelah, in
[GNSS|115B]the field of Ephron
[GNSS|115C]the son of Zohar
[GNSS|115D]the Hittite, which is
[GNSS|115E]before Mamre;


[GNSS|115F]25,10 the field
[GNSS|1160]which Abraham purchased
[GNSS|1161]of the children
[GNSS|1162]of Heth;


[GNSS|1163]there was Abraham buried,
[GNSS|1164]and Sarah his wife.


[GNSS|1165]25,11 And it came to
[GNSS|1166]pass after the death
[GNSS|1167]of Abraham, that God
[GNSS|1168]blessed Isaac his son;


[GNSS|1169]and Isaac dwelt
[GNSS|116A]by Beer-lahai-roi.


[GNSS|116B]{P}  25,12
[GNSS|116C]Now these are
[GNSS|116D]the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's
[GNSS|116E]son, whom Hagar
[GNSS|116F]the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bore
[GNSS|1170]unto Abraham.


[GNSS|1171]25,13 And these are
[GNSS|1172]the names of
[GNSS|1173]the sons of Ishmael,
[GNSS|1174]by their names,
[GNSS|1175]according to their generations:
[GNSS|1176]the first-born of Ishmael, Nebaioth;


[GNSS|1177]and Kedar, and Adbeel,
[GNSS|1178]and Mibsam, 25,14
[GNSS|1179]and Mishma, and Dumah,
[GNSS|117A]and Massa;


[GNSS|117B]25,15 Hadad, and Tema, Jetur,
[GNSS|117C]Naphish, and Kedem;


[GNSS|117D]25,16 these are
[GNSS|117E]the sons of Ishmael,
[GNSS|117F]and these are their names,
[GNSS|1180]by their villages,
[GNSS|1181]and by their encampments;


[GNSS|1182]twelve princes according to their
[GNSS|1183]nations.


[GNSS|1184]25,17 And these are
[GNSS|1185]the years of
[GNSS|1186]the life of Ishmael,
[GNSS|1187]a hundred and thirty
[GNSS|1188]and seven years;


[GNSS|1189]and he expired
[GNSS|118A]and died;


[GNSS|118B]and was gathered unto his
[GNSS|118C]people.


[GNSS|118D]25,18 And they dwelt from
[GNSS|118E]Havilah unto Shur that is
[GNSS|118F]before Egypt, as thou goest
[GNSS|1190]toward Asshur: over against all
[GNSS|1191]his brethren he did settle.


[GNSS|1192]{P}  25,19
[GNSS|1193]And these are
[GNSS|1194]the generations of Isaac, Abraham's
[GNSS|1195]son: Abraham begot Isaac.


[GNSS|1196]25,20 And Isaac was forty
[GNSS|1197]years old when he took
[GNSS|1198]Rebekah, the daughter
[GNSS|1199]of Bethuel the Aramean,
[GNSS|119A]of Paddan-aram, the sister
[GNSS|119B]of Laban the Aramean, to
[GNSS|119C]be his wife.


[GNSS|119D]25,21 And Isaac
[GNSS|119E]entreated the LORD
[GNSS|119F]for his wife,
[GNSS|11A0]because she was barren;


[GNSS|11A1]and the LORD let Himself
[GNSS|11A2]be entreated of him,
[GNSS|11A3]and Rebekah his wife conceived.


[GNSS|11A4]25,22 And the children
[GNSS|11A5]struggled together within her;


[GNSS|11A6]and she said: 'If it
[GNSS|11A7]be so, wherefore
[GNSS|11A8]do I live?'
[GNSS|11A9]And she went to inquire
[GNSS|11AA]of the LORD.


[GNSS|11AB]25,23 And the LORD
[GNSS|11AC]said unto her: Two nations
[GNSS|11AD]are in thy womb,
[GNSS|11AE]and two peoples shall be
[GNSS|11AF]separated from thy bowels;


[GNSS|11B0]and the one people shall
[GNSS|11B1]be stronger than
[GNSS|11B2]the other people;


[GNSS|11B3]and the elder shall serve
[GNSS|11B4]the younger.


[GNSS|11B5]25,24 And when her days
[GNSS|11B6]to be delivered were fulfilled,
[GNSS|11B7]behold, there were twins in
[GNSS|11B8]her womb.


[GNSS|11B9]25,25 And the
[GNSS|11BA]first came forth ruddy, all
[GNSS|11BB]over like a hairy mantle;


[GNSS|11BC]and they called his name
[GNSS|11BD]Esau.


[GNSS|11BE]25,26 And after that came
[GNSS|11BF]forth his brother,
[GNSS|11C0]and his hand
[GNSS|11C1]had hold on Esau's heel;


[GNSS|11C2]and his name was
[GNSS|11C3]called Jacob.


[GNSS|11C4]And Isaac was threescore years
[GNSS|11C5]old when she bore them.


[GNSS|11C6]25,27 And the boys grew;


[GNSS|11C7]and Esau was
[GNSS|11C8]a cunning hunter,
[GNSS|11C9]a man of
[GNSS|11CA]the field;


[GNSS|11CB]and Jacob was
[GNSS|11CC]a quiet man,
[GNSS|11CD]dwelling in tents.


[GNSS|11CE]25,28 Now Isaac
[GNSS|11CF]loved Esau, because he did
[GNSS|11D0]eat of his venison;


[GNSS|11D1]and Rebekah loved Jacob.


[GNSS|11D2]25,29 And Jacob sod pottage;


[GNSS|11D3]and Esau came in from
[GNSS|11D4]the field, and he was
[GNSS|11D5]faint.


[GNSS|11D6]25,30 And Esau
[GNSS|11D7]said to Jacob: 'Let me
[GNSS|11D8]swallow, I pray thee, some
[GNSS|11D9]of this red, red pottage;


[GNSS|11DA]for I am faint.'
[GNSS|11DB]Therefore was his name
[GNSS|11DC]called Edom.


[GNSS|11DD]25,31 And Jacob said: 'Sell
[GNSS|11DE]me first thy birthright.' 25,32
[GNSS|11DF]And Esau said: 'Behold, I
[GNSS|11E0]am at the point to
[GNSS|11E1]die;


[GNSS|11E2]and what profit shall
[GNSS|11E3]the birthright do to me?'
[GNSS|11E4]25,33 And Jacob said: 'Swear
[GNSS|11E5]to me first';


[GNSS|11E6]and he swore unto him;


[GNSS|11E7]and he sold his birthright
[GNSS|11E8]unto Jacob.


[GNSS|11E9]25,34 And Jacob gave Esau
[GNSS|11EA]bread and pottage
[GNSS|11EB]of lentils;


[GNSS|11EC]and he did eat
[GNSS|11ED]and drink, and rose up,
[GNSS|11EE]and went his way.


[GNSS|11EF]So Esau despised his birthright.


[GNSS|11F0]{P}  26,1
[GNSS|11F1]And there was
[GNSS|11F2]a famine in
[GNSS|11F3]the land, beside
[GNSS|11F4]the first famine that was
[GNSS|11F5]in the days
[GNSS|11F6]of Abraham.


[GNSS|11F7]And Isaac went unto Abimelech
[GNSS|11F8]king of the Philistines unto
[GNSS|11F9]Gerar.


[GNSS|11FA]26,2 And the LORD
[GNSS|11FB]appeared unto him,
[GNSS|11FC]and said: 'Go
[GNSS|11FD]not down unto Egypt;


[GNSS|11FE]dwell in the land
[GNSS|11FF]which I shall tell thee
[GNSS|1200]of. 26,3 Sojourn in this
[GNSS|1201]land, and I
[GNSS|1202]will be with thee,
[GNSS|1203]and will bless thee;


[GNSS|1204]for unto thee,
[GNSS|1205]and unto thy seed, I
[GNSS|1206]will give all these lands,
[GNSS|1207]and I will establish
[GNSS|1208]the oath which I swore
[GNSS|1209]unto Abraham thy father;


[GNSS|120A]26,4 and I
[GNSS|120B]will multiply thy seed
[GNSS|120C]as the stars
[GNSS|120D]of heaven, and
[GNSS|120E]will give unto thy seed
[GNSS|120F]all these lands;


[GNSS|1210]and by thy seed shall
[GNSS|1211]all the nations
[GNSS|1212]of the earth bless themselves;


[GNSS|1213]26,5 because that Abraham
[GNSS|1214]hearkened to My voice,
[GNSS|1215]and kept My charge, My
[GNSS|1216]commandments, My statutes,
[GNSS|1217]and My laws.' 26,6
[GNSS|1218]And Isaac dwelt in Gerar.


[GNSS|1219]26,7 And the men
[GNSS|121A]of the place
[GNSS|121B]asked him of his wife;


[GNSS|121C]and he said: 'She is
[GNSS|121D]my sister';


[GNSS|121E]for he feared to say:
[GNSS|121F]'My wife';


[GNSS|1220]'lest the men
[GNSS|1221]of the place should kill
[GNSS|1222]me for Rebekah,
[GNSS|1223]because she is fair to
[GNSS|1224]look upon.' 26,8
[GNSS|1225]And it came to pass,
[GNSS|1226]when he had been there
[GNSS|1227]a long time, that Abimelech
[GNSS|1228]king of the Philistines
[GNSS|1229]looked out at
[GNSS|122A]a window, and saw, and,
[GNSS|122B]behold, Isaac was
[GNSS|122C]sporting with Rebekah his wife.


[GNSS|122D]26,9 And Abimelech
[GNSS|122E]called Isaac, and said: 'Behold,
[GNSS|122F]of a surety she is
[GNSS|1230]thy wife;


[GNSS|1231]and how saidst thou: She
[GNSS|1232]is my sister?'
[GNSS|1233]And Isaac said unto him:
[GNSS|1234]'Because I said:
[GNSS|1235]Lest I die
[GNSS|1236]because of her.' 26,10
[GNSS|1237]And Abimelech said: 'What is
[GNSS|1238]this thou hast done unto
[GNSS|1239]us? one of
[GNSS|123A]the people might easily
[GNSS|123B]have lain with thy wife,
[GNSS|123C]and thou wouldest
[GNSS|123D]have brought guiltiness upon us.'
[GNSS|123E]26,11 And Abimelech
[GNSS|123F]charged all the people, saying:
[GNSS|1240]'He that toucheth this man
[GNSS|1241]or his wife shall surely
[GNSS|1242]be put to death.' 26,12
[GNSS|1243]And Isaac sowed in that
[GNSS|1244]land, and found in
[GNSS|1245]the same year
[GNSS|1246]a hundredfold;


[GNSS|1247]and the LORD
[GNSS|1248]blessed him.


[GNSS|1249]26,13 And the man
[GNSS|124A]waxed great, and grew
[GNSS|124B]more and more
[GNSS|124C]until he became very great.


[GNSS|124D]26,14 And he
[GNSS|124E]had possessions of flocks,
[GNSS|124F]and possessions of herds,
[GNSS|1250]and a great household;


[GNSS|1251]and the Philistines
[GNSS|1252]envied him.


[GNSS|1253]26,15 Now all
[GNSS|1254]the wells which his father's
[GNSS|1255]servants had digged in
[GNSS|1256]the days of Abraham his
[GNSS|1257]father, the Philistines
[GNSS|1258]had stopped them,
[GNSS|1259]and filled them
[GNSS|125A]with earth.


[GNSS|125B]26,16 And Abimelech
[GNSS|125C]said unto Isaac: 'Go from
[GNSS|125D]us; for thou art much
[GNSS|125E]mightier than we.' 26,17
[GNSS|125F]And Isaac departed thence,
[GNSS|1260]and encamped in
[GNSS|1261]the valley of Gerar,
[GNSS|1262]and dwelt there.


[GNSS|1263]26,18 And Isaac
[GNSS|1264]digged again the wells
[GNSS|1265]of water, which they
[GNSS|1266]had digged in
[GNSS|1267]the days of Abraham his
[GNSS|1268]father;


[GNSS|1269]for the Philistines
[GNSS|126A]had stopped them
[GNSS|126B]after the death
[GNSS|126C]of Abraham;


[GNSS|126D]and he called their names
[GNSS|126E]after the names
[GNSS|126F]by which his father
[GNSS|1270]had called them.


[GNSS|1271]26,19 And Isaac's servants
[GNSS|1272]digged in the valley,
[GNSS|1273]and found there
[GNSS|1274]a well of
[GNSS|1275]living water.


[GNSS|1276]26,20 And the herdmen
[GNSS|1277]of Gerar strove
[GNSS|1278]with Isaac's herdmen, saying: 'The
[GNSS|1279]water is ours.'
[GNSS|127A]And he called
[GNSS|127B]the name of
[GNSS|127C]the well Esek;


[GNSS|127D]because they contended
[GNSS|127E]with him.


[GNSS|127F]26,21 And they
[GNSS|1280]digged another well,
[GNSS|1281]and they strove
[GNSS|1282]for that also.


[GNSS|1283]And he called
[GNSS|1284]the name of it Sitnah.


[GNSS|1285]26,22 And he
[GNSS|1286]removed from thence,
[GNSS|1287]and digged another well;


[GNSS|1288]and for that they strove
[GNSS|1289]not.


[GNSS|128A]And he called
[GNSS|128B]the name of it Rehoboth;


[GNSS|128C]and he said: 'For
[GNSS|128D]now the LORD hath
[GNSS|128E]made room for us,
[GNSS|128F]and we shall be fruitful
[GNSS|1290]in the land.' 26,23
[GNSS|1291]And he went up from
[GNSS|1292]thence to Beer-sheba.


[GNSS|1293]26,24 And the LORD
[GNSS|1294]appeared unto him
[GNSS|1295]the same night,
[GNSS|1296]and said: 'I am
[GNSS|1297]the God of Abraham thy
[GNSS|1298]father.


[GNSS|1299]Fear not, for I am
[GNSS|129A]with thee, and
[GNSS|129B]will bless thee,
[GNSS|129C]and multiply thy seed
[GNSS|129D]for My servant Abraham's sake.'
[GNSS|129E]26,25 And he
[GNSS|129F]builded an altar there,
[GNSS|12A0]and called upon
[GNSS|12A1]the name of
[GNSS|12A2]the LORD, and
[GNSS|12A3]pitched his tent there;


[GNSS|12A4]and there Isaac's servants
[GNSS|12A5]digged a well.


[GNSS|12A6]26,26 Then Abimelech
[GNSS|12A7]went to him from Gerar,
[GNSS|12A8]and Ahuzzath his friend,
[GNSS|12A9]and Phicol the captain
[GNSS|12AA]of his host.


[GNSS|12AB]26,27 And Isaac
[GNSS|12AC]said unto them: 'Wherefore are
[GNSS|12AD]ye come unto me,
[GNSS|12AE]seeing ye hate me,
[GNSS|12AF]and have sent me away
[GNSS|12B0]from you?' 26,28
[GNSS|12B1]And they said: 'We saw
[GNSS|12B2]plainly that the LORD was
[GNSS|12B3]with thee;


[GNSS|12B4]and we said: Let there
[GNSS|12B5]now be an oath betwixt
[GNSS|12B6]us, even betwixt us
[GNSS|12B7]and thee, and let us
[GNSS|12B8]make a covenant
[GNSS|12B9]with thee;


[GNSS|12BA]26,29 that thou wilt
[GNSS|12BB]do us no hurt,
[GNSS|12BC]as we have
[GNSS|12BD]not touched thee,
[GNSS|12BE]and as we
[GNSS|12BF]have done unto thee
[GNSS|12C0]nothing but good,
[GNSS|12C1]and have sent thee away
[GNSS|12C2]in peace;


[GNSS|12C3]thou art now
[GNSS|12C4]the blessed of
[GNSS|12C5]the LORD.' 26,30
[GNSS|12C6]And he made them
[GNSS|12C7]a feast, and they did
[GNSS|12C8]eat and drink.


[GNSS|12C9]26,31 And they rose up
[GNSS|12CA]betimes in the morning,
[GNSS|12CB]and swore one to another;


[GNSS|12CC]and Isaac sent them away,
[GNSS|12CD]and they departed from him
[GNSS|12CE]in peace.


[GNSS|12CF]26,32 And it came to
[GNSS|12D0]pass the same day, that
[GNSS|12D1]Isaac's servants came,
[GNSS|12D2]and told him
[GNSS|12D3]concerning the well
[GNSS|12D4]which they had digged,
[GNSS|12D5]and said unto him: 'We
[GNSS|12D6]have found water.' 26,33
[GNSS|12D7]And he called it Shibah.


[GNSS|12D8]Therefore the name
[GNSS|12D9]of the city is Beer-sheba
[GNSS|12DA]unto this day.


[GNSS|12DB]{S} 26,34 And
[GNSS|12DC]when Esau was forty years
[GNSS|12DD]old, he took to wife
[GNSS|12DE]Judith the daughter
[GNSS|12DF]of Beeri the Hittite,
[GNSS|12E0]and Basemath the daughter
[GNSS|12E1]of Elon the Hittite.


[GNSS|12E2]26,35 And they were
[GNSS|12E3]a bitterness of spirit unto
[GNSS|12E4]Isaac and to Rebekah.


[GNSS|12E5]{S} 27,1 And it came
[GNSS|12E6]to pass, that
[GNSS|12E7]when Isaac was old,
[GNSS|12E8]and his eyes were dim,
[GNSS|12E9]so that he
[GNSS|12EA]could not see, he
[GNSS|12EB]called Esau his elder son,
[GNSS|12EC]and said unto him: 'My
[GNSS|12ED]son';


[GNSS|12EE]and he said unto him:
[GNSS|12EF]'Here am I.' 27,2
[GNSS|12F0]And he said: 'Behold now,
[GNSS|12F1]I am old, I know
[GNSS|12F2]not the day
[GNSS|12F3]of my death.


[GNSS|12F4]27,3 Now therefore take, I
[GNSS|12F5]pray thee, thy weapons, thy
[GNSS|12F6]quiver and thy bow,
[GNSS|12F7]and go out to
[GNSS|12F8]the field, and take me
[GNSS|12F9]venison;


[GNSS|12FA]27,4 and make me savoury
[GNSS|12FB]food, such as I love,
[GNSS|12FC]and bring it to me,
[GNSS|12FD]that I may eat;


[GNSS|12FE]that my soul may bless
[GNSS|12FF]thee before I die.' 27,5
[GNSS|1300]And Rebekah heard
[GNSS|1301]when Isaac spoke to Esau
[GNSS|1302]his son.


[GNSS|1303]And Esau went to
[GNSS|1304]the field to hunt
[GNSS|1305]for venison, and to
[GNSS|1306]bring it. 27,6
[GNSS|1307]And Rebekah spoke unto Jacob
[GNSS|1308]her son, saying: 'Behold, I
[GNSS|1309]heard thy father speak unto
[GNSS|130A]Esau thy brother, saying: 27,7
[GNSS|130B]Bring me venison,
[GNSS|130C]and make me savoury food,
[GNSS|130D]that I may eat,
[GNSS|130E]and bless thee
[GNSS|130F]before the LORD
[GNSS|1310]before my death.


[GNSS|1311]27,8 Now therefore, my son,
[GNSS|1312]hearken to my voice
[GNSS|1313]according to that
[GNSS|1314]which I command thee.


[GNSS|1315]27,9 Go now to
[GNSS|1316]the flock, and fetch me
[GNSS|1317]from thence two good kids
[GNSS|1318]of the goats;


[GNSS|1319]and I will
[GNSS|131A]make them savoury food
[GNSS|131B]for thy father, such
[GNSS|131C]as he loveth;


[GNSS|131D]27,10 and thou shalt
[GNSS|131E]bring it to thy father,
[GNSS|131F]that he may eat,
[GNSS|1320]so that he may bless
[GNSS|1321]thee before his death.' 27,11
[GNSS|1322]And Jacob said to Rebekah
[GNSS|1323]his mother: 'Behold, Esau my
[GNSS|1324]brother is a hairy man,
[GNSS|1325]and I am
[GNSS|1326]a smooth man.


[GNSS|1327]27,12 My father peradventure
[GNSS|1328]will feel me,
[GNSS|1329]and I shall seem to
[GNSS|132A]him as a mocker;


[GNSS|132B]and I shall
[GNSS|132C]bring a curse upon me,
[GNSS|132D]and not a blessing.' 27,13
[GNSS|132E]And his mother
[GNSS|132F]said unto him: 'Upon me
[GNSS|1330]be thy curse, my son;


[GNSS|1331]only hearken to my voice,
[GNSS|1332]and go fetch me them.'
[GNSS|1333]27,14 And he went,
[GNSS|1334]and fetched, and brought them
[GNSS|1335]to his mother;


[GNSS|1336]and his mother
[GNSS|1337]made savoury food, such
[GNSS|1338]as his father loved.


[GNSS|1339]27,15 And Rebekah took
[GNSS|133A]the choicest garments
[GNSS|133B]of Esau her elder son,
[GNSS|133C]which were with her in
[GNSS|133D]the house, and put them
[GNSS|133E]upon Jacob her younger son.


[GNSS|133F]27,16 And she put
[GNSS|1340]the skins of
[GNSS|1341]the kids of
[GNSS|1342]the goats upon his hands,
[GNSS|1343]and upon the smooth
[GNSS|1344]of his neck.


[GNSS|1345]27,17 And she gave
[GNSS|1346]the savoury food
[GNSS|1347]and the bread,
[GNSS|1348]which she had prepared, into
[GNSS|1349]the hand of her son
[GNSS|134A]Jacob.


[GNSS|134B]27,18 And he came unto
[GNSS|134C]his father, and said: 'My
[GNSS|134D]father';


[GNSS|134E]and he said: 'Here am
[GNSS|134F]I; who art thou, my
[GNSS|1350]son?' 27,19 And Jacob
[GNSS|1351]said unto his father: 'I
[GNSS|1352]am Esau thy first-born;


[GNSS|1353]I have done
[GNSS|1354]according as thou badest me.
[GNSS|1355]Arise, I pray thee, sit
[GNSS|1356]and eat of my venison,
[GNSS|1357]that thy soul may bless
[GNSS|1358]me.' 27,20 And Isaac
[GNSS|1359]said unto his son: 'How
[GNSS|135A]is it that thou hast
[GNSS|135B]found it so quickly, my
[GNSS|135C]son?' And he said: 'Because
[GNSS|135D]the LORD thy God sent
[GNSS|135E]me good speed.' 27,21
[GNSS|135F]And Isaac said unto Jacob:
[GNSS|1360]'Come near, I pray thee,
[GNSS|1361]that I may feel thee,
[GNSS|1362]my son, whether thou be
[GNSS|1363]my very son Esau
[GNSS|1364]or not.' 27,22
[GNSS|1365]And Jacob went near unto
[GNSS|1366]Isaac his father;


[GNSS|1367]and he felt him,
[GNSS|1368]and said: 'The voice is
[GNSS|1369]the voice of Jacob,
[GNSS|136A]but the hands are
[GNSS|136B]the hands of Esau.' 27,23
[GNSS|136C]And he discerned him not,
[GNSS|136D]because his hands were hairy,
[GNSS|136E]as his brother Esau's hands;


[GNSS|136F]so he blessed him.


[GNSS|1370]27,24 And he said: 'Art
[GNSS|1371]thou my very son Esau?'
[GNSS|1372]And he said: 'I am.'
[GNSS|1373]27,25 And he said:
[GNSS|1374]'Bring it near to me,
[GNSS|1375]and I will eat
[GNSS|1376]of my son's venison, that
[GNSS|1377]my soul may bless thee.'
[GNSS|1378]And he brought it near
[GNSS|1379]to him, and he did
[GNSS|137A]eat;


[GNSS|137B]and he brought him wine,
[GNSS|137C]and he drank.


[GNSS|137D]27,26 And his father Isaac
[GNSS|137E]said unto him: 'Come near
[GNSS|137F]now, and kiss me, my
[GNSS|1380]son.' 27,27 And he came
[GNSS|1381]near, and kissed him.


[GNSS|1382]And he smelled
[GNSS|1383]the smell of his raiment,
[GNSS|1384]and blessed him,
[GNSS|1385]and said: See,
[GNSS|1386]the smell of my son
[GNSS|1387]is as the smell
[GNSS|1388]of a field
[GNSS|1389]which the LORD hath blessed.


[GNSS|138A]27,28 So God give thee
[GNSS|138B]of the dew
[GNSS|138C]of heaven, and
[GNSS|138D]of the fat places
[GNSS|138E]of the earth,
[GNSS|138F]and plenty of corn
[GNSS|1390]and wine.


[GNSS|1391]27,29 Let peoples serve thee,
[GNSS|1392]and nations bow down to
[GNSS|1393]thee.


[GNSS|1394]Be lord over thy brethren,
[GNSS|1395]and let thy mother's sons
[GNSS|1396]bow down to thee.


[GNSS|1397]Cursed be every one that
[GNSS|1398]curseth thee, and
[GNSS|1399]blessed be every one that
[GNSS|139A]blesseth thee.


[GNSS|139B]27,30 And it came to
[GNSS|139C]pass, as soon
[GNSS|139D]as Isaac had
[GNSS|139E]made an end
[GNSS|139F]of blessing Jacob,
[GNSS|13A0]and Jacob was
[GNSS|13A1]yet scarce gone out from
[GNSS|13A2]the presence of Isaac his
[GNSS|13A3]father, that Esau his brother
[GNSS|13A4]came in from his hunting.


[GNSS|13A5]27,31 And he
[GNSS|13A6]also made savoury food,
[GNSS|13A7]and brought it unto his
[GNSS|13A8]father;


[GNSS|13A9]and he said unto his
[GNSS|13AA]father: 'Let my father arise,
[GNSS|13AB]and eat of his son's
[GNSS|13AC]venison, that thy soul may
[GNSS|13AD]bless me.' 27,32
[GNSS|13AE]And Isaac his father
[GNSS|13AF]said unto him: 'Who art
[GNSS|13B0]thou?' And he said: 'I
[GNSS|13B1]am thy son, thy first-born,
[GNSS|13B2]Esau.' 27,33 And Isaac
[GNSS|13B3]trembled very exceedingly,
[GNSS|13B4]and said: 'Who
[GNSS|13B5]then is he that hath
[GNSS|13B6]taken venison, and brought it
[GNSS|13B7]me, and I
[GNSS|13B8]have eaten of all
[GNSS|13B9]before thou camest,
[GNSS|13BA]and have blessed him? yea,
[GNSS|13BB]and he shall be blessed.'
[GNSS|13BC]27,34 When Esau heard
[GNSS|13BD]the words of his father,
[GNSS|13BE]he cried with an
[GNSS|13BF]exceeding great and bitter cry,
[GNSS|13C0]and said unto his father:
[GNSS|13C1]'Bless me, even me also,
[GNSS|13C2]O my father.' 27,35
[GNSS|13C3]And he said: 'Thy brother
[GNSS|13C4]came with guile,
[GNSS|13C5]and hath taken away thy
[GNSS|13C6]blessing.' 27,36 And he said:
[GNSS|13C7]'Is not he rightly
[GNSS|13C8]named Jacob? for he hath
[GNSS|13C9]supplanted me these two times:
[GNSS|13CA]he took away my birthright;


[GNSS|13CB]and, behold, now he hath
[GNSS|13CC]taken away my blessing.'
[GNSS|13CD]And he said: 'Hast thou
[GNSS|13CE]not reserved a
[GNSS|13CF]blessing for me?' 27,37
[GNSS|13D0]And Isaac answered
[GNSS|13D1]and said unto Esau: 'Behold,
[GNSS|13D2]I have made him thy
[GNSS|13D3]lord, and all his brethren
[GNSS|13D4]have I given to him
[GNSS|13D5]for servants;


[GNSS|13D6]and with corn
[GNSS|13D7]and wine have I
[GNSS|13D8]sustained him;


[GNSS|13D9]and what then shall I
[GNSS|13DA]do for thee, my son?'
[GNSS|13DB]27,38 And Esau
[GNSS|13DC]said unto his father: 'Hast
[GNSS|13DD]thou but one blessing, my
[GNSS|13DE]father? bless me,
[GNSS|13DF]even me also, O my
[GNSS|13E0]father.' And Esau
[GNSS|13E1]lifted up his voice,
[GNSS|13E2]and wept.


[GNSS|13E3]27,39 And Isaac his father
[GNSS|13E4]answered and said unto him:
[GNSS|13E5]Behold, of the fat places
[GNSS|13E6]of the earth shall be
[GNSS|13E7]thy dwelling, and
[GNSS|13E8]of the dew
[GNSS|13E9]of heaven from above;


[GNSS|13EA]27,40 And by thy sword
[GNSS|13EB]shalt thou live,
[GNSS|13EC]and thou shalt serve thy
[GNSS|13ED]brother;


[GNSS|13EE]and it shall come to
[GNSS|13EF]pass when thou shalt break
[GNSS|13F0]loose, that thou shalt shake
[GNSS|13F1]his yoke from off thy
[GNSS|13F2]neck.


[GNSS|13F3]27,41 And Esau
[GNSS|13F4]hated Jacob because
[GNSS|13F5]of the blessing wherewith his
[GNSS|13F6]father blessed him.


[GNSS|13F7]And Esau said in his
[GNSS|13F8]heart: 'Let the days
[GNSS|13F9]of mourning for my father
[GNSS|13FA]be at hand;


[GNSS|13FB]then will I slay my
[GNSS|13FC]brother Jacob.' 27,42
[GNSS|13FD]And the words
[GNSS|13FE]of Esau her elder son
[GNSS|13FF]were told to Rebekah;


[GNSS|1400]and she sent
[GNSS|1401]and called Jacob her younger
[GNSS|1402]son, and said unto him:
[GNSS|1403]'Behold, thy brother Esau,
[GNSS|1404]as touching thee, doth comfort
[GNSS|1405]himself, purposing to kill thee.


[GNSS|1406]27,43 Now therefore, my son,
[GNSS|1407]hearken to my voice;


[GNSS|1408]and arise, flee thou to
[GNSS|1409]Laban my brother to Haran;


[GNSS|140A]27,44 and tarry
[GNSS|140B]with him a
[GNSS|140C]few days, until thy brother's
[GNSS|140D]fury turn away;


[GNSS|140E]27,45 until thy brother's anger
[GNSS|140F]turn away from thee,
[GNSS|1410]and he forget that
[GNSS|1411]which thou hast done to
[GNSS|1412]him;


[GNSS|1413]then I will send,
[GNSS|1414]and fetch thee from thence;


[GNSS|1415]why should I be
[GNSS|1416]bereaved of you both in
[GNSS|1417]one day?' 27,46
[GNSS|1418]And Rebekah said to Isaac:
[GNSS|1419]'I am weary
[GNSS|141A]of my life
[GNSS|141B]because of the daughters
[GNSS|141C]of Heth.


[GNSS|141D]If Jacob take
[GNSS|141E]a wife of
[GNSS|141F]the daughters of Heth, such
[GNSS|1420]as these, of
[GNSS|1421]the daughters of
[GNSS|1422]the land, what good shall
[GNSS|1423]my life do me?' 28,1
[GNSS|1424]And Isaac called Jacob,
[GNSS|1425]and blessed him,
[GNSS|1426]and charged him,
[GNSS|1427]and said unto him: 'Thou
[GNSS|1428]shalt not take
[GNSS|1429]a wife of
[GNSS|142A]the daughters of Canaan.


[GNSS|142B]28,2 Arise, go to Paddan-aram,
[GNSS|142C]to the house
[GNSS|142D]of Bethuel thy mother's father;


[GNSS|142E]and take thee
[GNSS|142F]a wife from thence
[GNSS|1430]of the daughters
[GNSS|1431]of Laban thy mother's brother.


[GNSS|1432]28,3 And God Almighty bless
[GNSS|1433]thee, and make thee fruitful,
[GNSS|1434]and multiply thee, that thou
[GNSS|1435]mayest be a congregation
[GNSS|1436]of peoples;


[GNSS|1437]28,4 and give thee
[GNSS|1438]the blessing of Abraham, to
[GNSS|1439]thee, and to thy seed
[GNSS|143A]with thee;


[GNSS|143B]that thou mayest inherit
[GNSS|143C]the land of thy sojournings,
[GNSS|143D]which God gave unto Abraham.'
[GNSS|143E]28,5 And Isaac sent away
[GNSS|143F]Jacob;


[GNSS|1440]and he went to Paddan-aram
[GNSS|1441]unto Laban, son
[GNSS|1442]of Bethuel the Aramean,
[GNSS|1443]the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's
[GNSS|1444]and Esau's mother.


[GNSS|1445]28,6 Now Esau saw that
[GNSS|1446]Isaac had blessed Jacob
[GNSS|1447]and sent him away to
[GNSS|1448]Paddan-aram, to take him
[GNSS|1449]a wife from thence;


[GNSS|144A]and that as he
[GNSS|144B]blessed him he gave him
[GNSS|144C]a charge, saying: 'Thou shalt
[GNSS|144D]not take a wife
[GNSS|144E]of the daughters
[GNSS|144F]of Canaan';


[GNSS|1450]28,7 and that Jacob
[GNSS|1451]hearkened to his father
[GNSS|1452]and his mother,
[GNSS|1453]and was gone to Paddan-aram;


[GNSS|1454]28,8 and Esau saw that
[GNSS|1455]the daughters of Canaan
[GNSS|1456]pleased not Isaac his father;


[GNSS|1457]28,9 so Esau
[GNSS|1458]went unto Ishmael,
[GNSS|1459]and took unto
[GNSS|145A]the wives that he
[GNSS|145B]had Mahalath the daughter
[GNSS|145C]of Ishmael Abraham's son,
[GNSS|145D]the sister of Nebaioth, to
[GNSS|145E]be his wife.


[GNSS|145F]{S} 28,10 And Jacob
[GNSS|1460]went out from Beer-sheba,
[GNSS|1461]and went toward Haran.


[GNSS|1462]28,11 And he
[GNSS|1463]lighted upon the place,
[GNSS|1464]and tarried there all night,
[GNSS|1465]because the sun was set;


[GNSS|1466]and he took one
[GNSS|1467]of the stones
[GNSS|1468]of the place,
[GNSS|1469]and put it under his
[GNSS|146A]head, and lay down in
[GNSS|146B]that place to sleep.


[GNSS|146C]28,12 And he dreamed,
[GNSS|146D]and behold a ladder set
[GNSS|146E]up on the earth,
[GNSS|146F]and the top
[GNSS|1470]of it reached to heaven;


[GNSS|1471]and behold the angels
[GNSS|1472]of God ascending
[GNSS|1473]and descending on it. 28,13
[GNSS|1474]And, behold, the LORD stood
[GNSS|1475]beside him, and said: 'I
[GNSS|1476]am the LORD,
[GNSS|1477]the God of Abraham thy
[GNSS|1478]father, and the God
[GNSS|1479]of Isaac.


[GNSS|147A]The land whereon thou liest,
[GNSS|147B]to thee will I give
[GNSS|147C]it, and to thy seed.


[GNSS|147D]28,14 And thy seed shall
[GNSS|147E]be as the dust
[GNSS|147F]of the earth,
[GNSS|1480]and thou shalt spread abroad
[GNSS|1481]to the west,
[GNSS|1482]and to the east,
[GNSS|1483]and to the north,
[GNSS|1484]and to the south.


[GNSS|1485]And in thee
[GNSS|1486]and in thy seed shall
[GNSS|1487]all the families
[GNSS|1488]of the earth be blessed.


[GNSS|1489]28,15 And, behold, I am
[GNSS|148A]with thee, and
[GNSS|148B]will keep thee whithersoever thou
[GNSS|148C]goest, and will
[GNSS|148D]bring thee back into this
[GNSS|148E]land;


[GNSS|148F]for I will
[GNSS|1490]not leave thee,
[GNSS|1491]until I have done that
[GNSS|1492]which I have spoken to
[GNSS|1493]thee of.' 28,16
[GNSS|1494]And Jacob awaked out
[GNSS|1495]of his sleep,
[GNSS|1496]and he said: 'Surely
[GNSS|1497]the LORD is in this
[GNSS|1498]place;


[GNSS|1499]and I knew it not.'
[GNSS|149A]28,17 And he was afraid,
[GNSS|149B]and said: 'How full
[GNSS|149C]of awe is this place!
[GNSS|149D]this is none other
[GNSS|149E]than the house
[GNSS|149F]of God, and this is
[GNSS|14A0]the gate of heaven.' 28,18
[GNSS|14A1]And Jacob rose up early
[GNSS|14A2]in the morning,
[GNSS|14A3]and took the stone that
[GNSS|14A4]he had put under his
[GNSS|14A5]head, and set it up
[GNSS|14A6]for a pillar,
[GNSS|14A7]and poured oil upon
[GNSS|14A8]the top of it. 28,19
[GNSS|14A9]And he called
[GNSS|14AA]the name of that place
[GNSS|14AB]Beth-el, but the name
[GNSS|14AC]of the city was Luz
[GNSS|14AD]at the first.


[GNSS|14AE]28,20 And Jacob
[GNSS|14AF]vowed a vow, saying: 'If
[GNSS|14B0]God will be
[GNSS|14B1]with me, and
[GNSS|14B2]will keep me in this
[GNSS|14B3]way that I go,
[GNSS|14B4]and will give me bread
[GNSS|14B5]to eat, and raiment to
[GNSS|14B6]put on, 28,21
[GNSS|14B7]so that I come back
[GNSS|14B8]to my father's house in
[GNSS|14B9]peace, then shall
[GNSS|14BA]the LORD be my God,
[GNSS|14BB]28,22 and this stone,
[GNSS|14BC]which I have set up
[GNSS|14BD]for a pillar, shall be
[GNSS|14BE]God's house;


[GNSS|14BF]and of all that Thou
[GNSS|14C0]shalt give me I
[GNSS|14C1]will surely give
[GNSS|14C2]the tenth unto Thee.' 29,1
[GNSS|14C3]Then Jacob went on his
[GNSS|14C4]journey, and came to
[GNSS|14C5]the land of
[GNSS|14C6]the children of
[GNSS|14C7]the east.


[GNSS|14C8]29,2 And he looked,
[GNSS|14C9]and behold a well in
[GNSS|14CA]the field, and, lo, three
[GNSS|14CB]flocks of sheep
[GNSS|14CC]lying there by it.-For out
[GNSS|14CD]of that well they
[GNSS|14CE]watered the flocks.


[GNSS|14CF]And the stone upon
[GNSS|14D0]the well's mouth was great.


[GNSS|14D1]29,3 And thither were all
[GNSS|14D2]the flocks gathered;


[GNSS|14D3]and they rolled
[GNSS|14D4]the stone from
[GNSS|14D5]the well's mouth,
[GNSS|14D6]and watered the sheep,
[GNSS|14D7]and put the stone back
[GNSS|14D8]upon the well's mouth in
[GNSS|14D9]its place.- 29,4
[GNSS|14DA]And Jacob said unto them:
[GNSS|14DB]'My brethren, whence are ye?'
[GNSS|14DC]And they said: 'Of Haran
[GNSS|14DD]are we.' 29,5
[GNSS|14DE]And he said unto them:
[GNSS|14DF]'Know ye Laban
[GNSS|14E0]the son of Nahor?'
[GNSS|14E1]And they said: 'We know
[GNSS|14E2]him.' 29,6 And he
[GNSS|14E3]said unto them: 'Is it
[GNSS|14E4]well with him?'
[GNSS|14E5]And they said: 'It is
[GNSS|14E6]well;


[GNSS|14E7]and, behold, Rachel his daughter
[GNSS|14E8]cometh with the sheep.' 29,7
[GNSS|14E9]And he said: 'Lo, it
[GNSS|14EA]is yet high day,
[GNSS|14EB]neither is it
[GNSS|14EC]time that the cattle should
[GNSS|14ED]be gathered together;


[GNSS|14EE]water ye the sheep,
[GNSS|14EF]and go and feed them.'
[GNSS|14F0]29,8 And they said: 'We
[GNSS|14F1]cannot, until all
[GNSS|14F2]the flocks be
[GNSS|14F3]gathered together, and they roll
[GNSS|14F4]the stone from
[GNSS|14F5]the well's mouth;


[GNSS|14F6]then we water
[GNSS|14F7]the sheep.' 29,9
[GNSS|14F8]While he was
[GNSS|14F9]yet speaking with them, Rachel
[GNSS|14FA]came with her father's sheep;


[GNSS|14FB]for she tended them.


[GNSS|14FC]29,10 And it came to
[GNSS|14FD]pass, when Jacob saw Rachel
[GNSS|14FE]the daughter of Laban his
[GNSS|14FF]mother's brother, and
[GNSS|1500]the sheep of Laban his
[GNSS|1501]mother's brother, that Jacob
[GNSS|1502]went near, and
[GNSS|1503]rolled the stone from
[GNSS|1504]the well's mouth,
[GNSS|1505]and watered the flock
[GNSS|1506]of Laban his mother's brother.


[GNSS|1507]29,11 And Jacob
[GNSS|1508]kissed Rachel, and
[GNSS|1509]lifted up his voice,
[GNSS|150A]and wept.


[GNSS|150B]29,12 And Jacob told Rachel
[GNSS|150C]that he was her father's
[GNSS|150D]brother, and that he was
[GNSS|150E]Rebekah's son;


[GNSS|150F]and she ran
[GNSS|1510]and told her father.


[GNSS|1511]29,13 And it came to
[GNSS|1512]pass, when Laban heard
[GNSS|1513]the tidings of Jacob his
[GNSS|1514]sister's son, that he ran
[GNSS|1515]to meet him,
[GNSS|1516]and embraced him,
[GNSS|1517]and kissed him,
[GNSS|1518]and brought him to his
[GNSS|1519]house.


[GNSS|151A]And he told Laban all
[GNSS|151B]these things.


[GNSS|151C]29,14 And Laban
[GNSS|151D]said to him: 'Surely thou
[GNSS|151E]art my bone
[GNSS|151F]and my flesh.'
[GNSS|1520]And he abode
[GNSS|1521]with him the space
[GNSS|1522]of a month.


[GNSS|1523]29,15 And Laban
[GNSS|1524]said unto Jacob: 'Because thou
[GNSS|1525]art my brother, shouldest thou
[GNSS|1526]therefore serve me
[GNSS|1527]for nought? tell me,
[GNSS|1528]what shall thy wages be?'
[GNSS|1529]29,16 Now Laban
[GNSS|152A]had two daughters:
[GNSS|152B]the name of
[GNSS|152C]the elder was Leah,
[GNSS|152D]and the name
[GNSS|152E]of the younger was Rachel.


[GNSS|152F]29,17 And Leah's eyes were
[GNSS|1530]weak;


[GNSS|1531]but Rachel was
[GNSS|1532]of beautiful form
[GNSS|1533]and fair to look upon.


[GNSS|1534]29,18 And Jacob
[GNSS|1535]loved Rachel;


[GNSS|1536]and he said: 'I
[GNSS|1537]will serve thee seven years
[GNSS|1538]for Rachel thy younger daughter.'
[GNSS|1539]29,19 And Laban said: 'It
[GNSS|153A]is better that I give
[GNSS|153B]her to thee,
[GNSS|153C]than that I should give
[GNSS|153D]her to another man;


[GNSS|153E]abide with me.' 29,20
[GNSS|153F]And Jacob served seven years
[GNSS|1540]for Rachel;


[GNSS|1541]and they seemed unto him
[GNSS|1542]but a few days,
[GNSS|1543]for the love he
[GNSS|1544]had to her.


[GNSS|1545]29,21 And Jacob
[GNSS|1546]said unto Laban: 'Give me
[GNSS|1547]my wife, for my days
[GNSS|1548]are filled, that I may
[GNSS|1549]go in unto her.' 29,22
[GNSS|154A]And Laban gathered together all
[GNSS|154B]the men of
[GNSS|154C]the place, and
[GNSS|154D]made a feast.


[GNSS|154E]29,23 And it came to
[GNSS|154F]pass in the evening, that
[GNSS|1550]he took Leah his daughter,
[GNSS|1551]and brought her to him;


[GNSS|1552]and he went in unto
[GNSS|1553]her.


[GNSS|1554]29,24 And Laban gave Zilpah
[GNSS|1555]his handmaid unto his daughter
[GNSS|1556]Leah for a handmaid.


[GNSS|1557]29,25 And it came to
[GNSS|1558]pass in the
[GNSS|1559]morning that, behold, it was
[GNSS|155A]Leah;


[GNSS|155B]and he said to Laban:
[GNSS|155C]'What is this thou hast
[GNSS|155D]done unto me? did
[GNSS|155E]not I serve
[GNSS|155F]with thee for Rachel?
[GNSS|1560]wherefore then hast thou
[GNSS|1561]beguiled me?' 29,26
[GNSS|1562]And Laban said: 'It is
[GNSS|1563]not so done in our
[GNSS|1564]place, to give
[GNSS|1565]the younger before
[GNSS|1566]the first-born.


[GNSS|1567]29,27 Fulfil the week
[GNSS|1568]of this one,
[GNSS|1569]and we will give thee
[GNSS|156A]the other also
[GNSS|156B]for the service
[GNSS|156C]which thou shalt serve
[GNSS|156D]with me yet seven other
[GNSS|156E]years.' 29,28 And Jacob did
[GNSS|156F]so, and fulfilled her week;


[GNSS|1570]and he gave him Rachel
[GNSS|1571]his daughter to wife.


[GNSS|1572]29,29 And Laban gave to
[GNSS|1573]Rachel his daughter Bilhah his
[GNSS|1574]handmaid to be her handmaid.


[GNSS|1575]29,30 And he
[GNSS|1576]went in also unto Rachel,
[GNSS|1577]and he loved Rachel
[GNSS|1578]more than Leah,
[GNSS|1579]and served with him
[GNSS|157A]yet seven other years.


[GNSS|157B]29,31 And the LORD saw
[GNSS|157C]that Leah was hated,
[GNSS|157D]and he opened her womb;


[GNSS|157E]but Rachel was barren.


[GNSS|157F]29,32 And Leah conceived,
[GNSS|1580]and bore a son,
[GNSS|1581]and she called his name
[GNSS|1582]Reuben;


[GNSS|1583]for she said: 'Because
[GNSS|1584]the LORD hath
[GNSS|1585]looked upon my affliction;


[GNSS|1586]for now my husband
[GNSS|1587]will love me.' 29,33
[GNSS|1588]And she conceived again,
[GNSS|1589]and bore a son;


[GNSS|158A]and said: 'Because
[GNSS|158B]the LORD hath heard that
[GNSS|158C]I am hated, He hath
[GNSS|158D]therefore given me this son
[GNSS|158E]also.' And she
[GNSS|158F]called his name Simeon.


[GNSS|1590]29,34 And she
[GNSS|1591]conceived again, and bore
[GNSS|1592]a son;


[GNSS|1593]and said: 'Now this
[GNSS|1594]time will my husband be
[GNSS|1595]joined unto me,
[GNSS|1596]because I have borne him
[GNSS|1597]three sons.' Therefore was his
[GNSS|1598]name called Levi.


[GNSS|1599]29,35 And she
[GNSS|159A]conceived again, and bore
[GNSS|159B]a son;


[GNSS|159C]and she said: 'This
[GNSS|159D]time will I praise
[GNSS|159E]the LORD.' Therefore she
[GNSS|159F]called his name Judah;


[GNSS|15A0]and she left off bearing.


[GNSS|15A1]30,1 And when Rachel saw
[GNSS|15A2]that she bore Jacob
[GNSS|15A3]no children, Rachel
[GNSS|15A4]envied her sister;


[GNSS|15A5]and she said unto Jacob:
[GNSS|15A6]'Give me children,
[GNSS|15A7]or else I die.' 30,2
[GNSS|15A8]And Jacob's anger was
[GNSS|15A9]kindled against Rachel;


[GNSS|15AA]and he said: 'Am I
[GNSS|15AB]in God's stead,
[GNSS|15AC]who hath withheld from thee
[GNSS|15AD]the fruit of
[GNSS|15AE]the womb?' 30,3
[GNSS|15AF]And she said: 'Behold my
[GNSS|15B0]maid Bilhah, go in unto
[GNSS|15B1]her;


[GNSS|15B2]that she may bear upon
[GNSS|15B3]my knees, and I
[GNSS|15B4]also may be
[GNSS|15B5]builded up through her.' 30,4
[GNSS|15B6]And she gave him Bilhah
[GNSS|15B7]her handmaid to wife;


[GNSS|15B8]and Jacob went in unto
[GNSS|15B9]her.


[GNSS|15BA]30,5 And Bilhah conceived,
[GNSS|15BB]and bore Jacob
[GNSS|15BC]a son.


[GNSS|15BD]30,6 And Rachel said: 'God
[GNSS|15BE]hath judged me,
[GNSS|15BF]and hath also heard my
[GNSS|15C0]voice, and hath given me
[GNSS|15C1]a son.' Therefore
[GNSS|15C2]called she his name Dan.


[GNSS|15C3]30,7 And Bilhah Rachel's handmaid
[GNSS|15C4]conceived again, and bore Jacob
[GNSS|15C5]a second son.


[GNSS|15C6]30,8 And Rachel said: 'With
[GNSS|15C7]mighty wrestlings have I
[GNSS|15C8]wrestled with my sister,
[GNSS|15C9]and have prevailed.'
[GNSS|15CA]And she called his name
[GNSS|15CB]Naphtali.


[GNSS|15CC]30,9 When Leah saw that
[GNSS|15CD]she had left off bearing,
[GNSS|15CE]she took Zilpah her handmaid,
[GNSS|15CF]and gave her to Jacob
[GNSS|15D0]to wife.


[GNSS|15D1]30,10 And Zilpah Leah's handmaid
[GNSS|15D2]bore Jacob a son.


[GNSS|15D3]30,11 And Leah said: 'Fortune
[GNSS|15D4]is come!' And she
[GNSS|15D5]called his name Gad.


[GNSS|15D6]30,12 And Zilpah Leah's handmaid
[GNSS|15D7]bore Jacob a
[GNSS|15D8]second son.


[GNSS|15D9]30,13 And Leah said: 'Happy
[GNSS|15DA]am I! for
[GNSS|15DB]the daughters will call me
[GNSS|15DC]happy.' And she
[GNSS|15DD]called his name Asher.


[GNSS|15DE]30,14 And Reuben
[GNSS|15DF]went in the days
[GNSS|15E0]of wheat harvest,
[GNSS|15E1]and found mandrakes in
[GNSS|15E2]the field, and brought them
[GNSS|15E3]unto his mother Leah.


[GNSS|15E4]Then Rachel said to Leah:
[GNSS|15E5]'Give me, I pray thee,
[GNSS|15E6]of thy son's mandrakes.' 30,15
[GNSS|15E7]And she said unto her:
[GNSS|15E8]'Is it a small matter
[GNSS|15E9]that thou hast taken away
[GNSS|15EA]my husband? and wouldest thou
[GNSS|15EB]take away my son's mandrakes
[GNSS|15EC]also?' And Rachel said: 'Therefore
[GNSS|15ED]he shall lie
[GNSS|15EE]with thee to-night
[GNSS|15EF]for thy son's mandrakes.' 30,16
[GNSS|15F0]And Jacob came from
[GNSS|15F1]the field in
[GNSS|15F2]the evening, and Leah
[GNSS|15F3]went out to meet him,
[GNSS|15F4]and said: 'Thou
[GNSS|15F5]must come in unto me;
[GNSS|15F6]for I have surely
[GNSS|15F7]hired thee with my son's
[GNSS|15F8]mandrakes.' And he lay
[GNSS|15F9]with her that night.


[GNSS|15FA]30,17 And God
[GNSS|15FB]hearkened unto Leah,
[GNSS|15FC]and she conceived,
[GNSS|15FD]and bore Jacob
[GNSS|15FE]a fifth son.


[GNSS|15FF]30,18 And Leah said: 'God
[GNSS|1600]hath given me my hire,
[GNSS|1601]because I gave my handmaid
[GNSS|1602]to my husband.


[GNSS|1603]And she called his name
[GNSS|1604]Issachar.


[GNSS|1605]30,19 And Leah
[GNSS|1606]conceived again, and bore
[GNSS|1607]a sixth son to Jacob.


[GNSS|1608]30,20 And Leah said: 'God
[GNSS|1609]hath endowed me
[GNSS|160A]with a good dowry;


[GNSS|160B]now will my husband dwell
[GNSS|160C]with me, because I
[GNSS|160D]have borne him six sons.'
[GNSS|160E]And she called his name
[GNSS|160F]Zebulun.


[GNSS|1610]30,21 And afterwards she bore
[GNSS|1611]a daughter, and
[GNSS|1612]called her name Dinah.


[GNSS|1613]30,22 And God
[GNSS|1614]remembered Rachel, and God
[GNSS|1615]hearkened to her,
[GNSS|1616]and opened her womb.


[GNSS|1617]30,23 And she conceived,
[GNSS|1618]and bore a son,
[GNSS|1619]and said: 'God hath taken
[GNSS|161A]away my reproach.' 30,24
[GNSS|161B]And she called his name
[GNSS|161C]Joseph, saying: 'The LORD add
[GNSS|161D]to me another son.' 30,25
[GNSS|161E]And it came to pass,
[GNSS|161F]when Rachel had borne Joseph,
[GNSS|1620]that Jacob said unto Laban:
[GNSS|1621]'Send me away, that I
[GNSS|1622]may go unto mine own
[GNSS|1623]place, and to my country.


[GNSS|1624]30,26 Give me my wives
[GNSS|1625]and my children
[GNSS|1626]for whom I
[GNSS|1627]have served thee,
[GNSS|1628]and let me go;
[GNSS|1629]for thou knowest my service
[GNSS|162A]wherewith I have
[GNSS|162B]served thee.' 30,27
[GNSS|162C]And Laban said unto him:
[GNSS|162D]'If now I
[GNSS|162E]have found favour in thine
[GNSS|162F]eyes-I have observed
[GNSS|1630]the signs, and
[GNSS|1631]the LORD hath
[GNSS|1632]blessed me for thy sake.'
[GNSS|1633]30,28 And he said: 'Appoint
[GNSS|1634]me thy wages,
[GNSS|1635]and I will give it.'
[GNSS|1636]30,29 And he
[GNSS|1637]said unto him: 'Thou knowest
[GNSS|1638]how I have
[GNSS|1639]served thee, and
[GNSS|163A]how thy cattle
[GNSS|163B]have fared with me. 30,30
[GNSS|163C]For it was little
[GNSS|163D]which thou hadst
[GNSS|163E]before I came,
[GNSS|163F]and it hath
[GNSS|1640]increased abundantly;


[GNSS|1641]and the LORD hath
[GNSS|1642]blessed thee whithersoever I turned.


[GNSS|1643]And now when shall I
[GNSS|1644]provide for mine own house
[GNSS|1645]also?' 30,31 And he said:
[GNSS|1646]'What shall I give thee?'
[GNSS|1647]And Jacob said: 'Thou shalt
[GNSS|1648]not give me aught;


[GNSS|1649]if thou wilt
[GNSS|164A]do this thing
[GNSS|164B]for me, I
[GNSS|164C]will again feed thy flock
[GNSS|164D]and keep it. 30,32 I
[GNSS|164E]will pass through all thy
[GNSS|164F]flock to-day, removing from thence
[GNSS|1650]every speckled and
[GNSS|1651]spotted one, and every dark
[GNSS|1652]one among the sheep,
[GNSS|1653]and the spotted
[GNSS|1654]and speckled among
[GNSS|1655]the goats;


[GNSS|1656]and of such shall be
[GNSS|1657]my hire.


[GNSS|1658]30,33 So shall my righteousness
[GNSS|1659]witness against me hereafter,
[GNSS|165A]when thou shalt come to
[GNSS|165B]look over my hire that
[GNSS|165C]is before thee: every one
[GNSS|165D]that is not
[GNSS|165E]speckled and spotted among
[GNSS|165F]the goats, and dark among
[GNSS|1660]the sheep, that
[GNSS|1661]if found with me shall
[GNSS|1662]be counted stolen.' 30,34
[GNSS|1663]And Laban said: 'Behold,
[GNSS|1664]would it might be
[GNSS|1665]according to thy word.' 30,35
[GNSS|1666]And he removed that day
[GNSS|1667]the he-goats that were
[GNSS|1668]streaked and spotted,
[GNSS|1669]and all the she-goats that
[GNSS|166A]were speckled and spotted, every
[GNSS|166B]one that had white in
[GNSS|166C]it, and all
[GNSS|166D]the dark ones among
[GNSS|166E]the sheep, and gave them
[GNSS|166F]into the hand
[GNSS|1670]of his sons.


[GNSS|1671]30,36 And he set three
[GNSS|1672]days' journey betwixt himself
[GNSS|1673]and Jacob.


[GNSS|1674]And Jacob fed
[GNSS|1675]the rest of Laban's flocks.


[GNSS|1676]30,37 And Jacob took him
[GNSS|1677]rods of fresh poplar,
[GNSS|1678]and of the almond
[GNSS|1679]and of the plane-tree;


[GNSS|167A]and peeled white streaks in
[GNSS|167B]them, making the white appear
[GNSS|167C]which was in
[GNSS|167D]the rods.


[GNSS|167E]30,38 And he set
[GNSS|167F]the rods which he
[GNSS|1680]had peeled over against
[GNSS|1681]the flocks in
[GNSS|1682]the gutters in
[GNSS|1683]the watering-troughs where
[GNSS|1684]the flocks came to drink;


[GNSS|1685]and they conceived
[GNSS|1686]when they came to drink.


[GNSS|1687]30,39 And the flocks
[GNSS|1688]conceived at the sight
[GNSS|1689]of the rods,
[GNSS|168A]and the flocks brought forth
[GNSS|168B]streaked, speckled, and spotted.


[GNSS|168C]30,40 And Jacob
[GNSS|168D]separated the lambs-he
[GNSS|168E]also set the faces
[GNSS|168F]of the flocks toward
[GNSS|1690]the streaked and all
[GNSS|1691]the dark in
[GNSS|1692]the flock of Laban-and put
[GNSS|1693]his own droves apart,
[GNSS|1694]and put them
[GNSS|1695]not unto Laban's flock.


[GNSS|1696]30,41 And it came to
[GNSS|1697]pass, whensoever the stronger
[GNSS|1698]of the flock did conceive,
[GNSS|1699]that Jacob laid
[GNSS|169A]the rods before
[GNSS|169B]the eyes of
[GNSS|169C]the flock in
[GNSS|169D]the gutters, that they might
[GNSS|169E]conceive among the rods;


[GNSS|169F]30,42 but when
[GNSS|16A0]the flock were feeble, he
[GNSS|16A1]put them not in;
[GNSS|16A2]so the feebler were Laban's,
[GNSS|16A3]and the stronger Jacob's.


[GNSS|16A4]30,43 And the man
[GNSS|16A5]increased exceedingly, and
[GNSS|16A6]had large flocks,
[GNSS|16A7]and maid-servants and men-servants,
[GNSS|16A8]and camels and asses.


[GNSS|16A9]31,1 And he heard
[GNSS|16AA]the words of Laban's sons,
[GNSS|16AB]saying: 'Jacob hath taken away
[GNSS|16AC]all that was our father's;


[GNSS|16AD]and of that
[GNSS|16AE]which was our father's hath
[GNSS|16AF]he gotten all this wealth.'
[GNSS|16B0]31,2 And Jacob beheld
[GNSS|16B1]the countenance of Laban, and,
[GNSS|16B2]behold, it was
[GNSS|16B3]not toward him
[GNSS|16B4]as beforetime.


[GNSS|16B5]31,3 And the LORD
[GNSS|16B6]said unto Jacob: 'Return unto
[GNSS|16B7]the land of thy fathers,
[GNSS|16B8]and to thy kindred;


[GNSS|16B9]and I will be
[GNSS|16BA]with thee.' 31,4
[GNSS|16BB]And Jacob sent
[GNSS|16BC]and called Rachel
[GNSS|16BD]and Leah to
[GNSS|16BE]the field unto his flock,
[GNSS|16BF]31,5 and said unto them:
[GNSS|16C0]'I see your father's countenance,
[GNSS|16C1]that it is
[GNSS|16C2]not toward me
[GNSS|16C3]as beforetime;


[GNSS|16C4]but the God
[GNSS|16C5]of my father hath been
[GNSS|16C6]with me. 31,6
[GNSS|16C7]And ye know that
[GNSS|16C8]with all my power I
[GNSS|16C9]have served your father.


[GNSS|16CA]31,7 And your father hath
[GNSS|16CB]mocked me, and
[GNSS|16CC]changed my wages ten times;


[GNSS|16CD]but God suffered him
[GNSS|16CE]not to hurt me. 31,8
[GNSS|16CF]If he said thus:
[GNSS|16D0]The speckled shall be thy
[GNSS|16D1]wages;


[GNSS|16D2]then all the flock bore
[GNSS|16D3]speckled;


[GNSS|16D4]and if he
[GNSS|16D5]said thus: The
[GNSS|16D6]streaked shall be thy wages;


[GNSS|16D7]then bore all
[GNSS|16D8]the flock streaked.


[GNSS|16D9]31,9 Thus God hath taken
[GNSS|16DA]away the cattle
[GNSS|16DB]of your father,
[GNSS|16DC]and given them to me.
[GNSS|16DD]31,10 And it came to
[GNSS|16DE]pass at the
[GNSS|16DF]time that the flock conceived,
[GNSS|16E0]that I lifted up mine
[GNSS|16E1]eyes, and saw in
[GNSS|16E2]a dream, and, behold,
[GNSS|16E3]the he-goats which
[GNSS|16E4]leaped upon the flock were
[GNSS|16E5]streaked, speckled, and grizzled.


[GNSS|16E6]31,11 And the angel
[GNSS|16E7]of God said unto me
[GNSS|16E8]in the dream: Jacob;


[GNSS|16E9]and I said: Here am
[GNSS|16EA]I. 31,12 And he said:
[GNSS|16EB]Lift up now thine eyes,
[GNSS|16EC]and see, all
[GNSS|16ED]the he-goats which leap upon
[GNSS|16EE]the flock are streaked, speckled,
[GNSS|16EF]and grizzled;


[GNSS|16F0]for I have seen all
[GNSS|16F1]that Laban doeth unto thee.


[GNSS|16F2]31,13 I am
[GNSS|16F3]the God of Beth-el,
[GNSS|16F4]where thou didst anoint
[GNSS|16F5]a pillar, where thou didst
[GNSS|16F6]vow a vow unto Me.
[GNSS|16F7]Now arise, get thee out
[GNSS|16F8]from this land,
[GNSS|16F9]and return unto
[GNSS|16FA]the land of thy nativity.'
[GNSS|16FB]31,14 And Rachel
[GNSS|16FC]and Leah answered
[GNSS|16FD]and said unto him: 'Is
[GNSS|16FE]there yet any portion
[GNSS|16FF]or inheritance for us in
[GNSS|1700]our father's house? 31,15 Are
[GNSS|1701]we not accounted
[GNSS|1702]by him strangers?
[GNSS|1703]for he hath sold us,
[GNSS|1704]and hath also quite
[GNSS|1705]devoured our price.


[GNSS|1706]31,16 For all
[GNSS|1707]the riches which God hath
[GNSS|1708]taken away from our father,
[GNSS|1709]that is ours
[GNSS|170A]and our children's.


[GNSS|170B]Now then, whatsoever God hath
[GNSS|170C]said unto thee, do.' 31,17
[GNSS|170D]Then Jacob rose up,
[GNSS|170E]and set his sons
[GNSS|170F]and his wives upon
[GNSS|1710]the camels;


[GNSS|1711]31,18 and he
[GNSS|1712]carried away all his cattle,
[GNSS|1713]and all his substance
[GNSS|1714]which he had gathered,
[GNSS|1715]the cattle of his getting,
[GNSS|1716]which he had
[GNSS|1717]gathered in Paddan-aram, to
[GNSS|1718]go to Isaac his father
[GNSS|1719]unto the land
[GNSS|171A]of Canaan.


[GNSS|171B]31,19 Now Laban was gone
[GNSS|171C]to shear his sheep.


[GNSS|171D]And Rachel stole
[GNSS|171E]the teraphim that were her
[GNSS|171F]father's.


[GNSS|1720]31,20 And Jacob
[GNSS|1721]outwitted Laban the Aramean, in
[GNSS|1722]that he told him
[GNSS|1723]not that he fled.


[GNSS|1724]31,21 So he fled
[GNSS|1725]with all that he had;


[GNSS|1726]and he rose up,
[GNSS|1727]and passed over
[GNSS|1728]the River, and set his
[GNSS|1729]face toward the mountain
[GNSS|172A]of Gilead.


[GNSS|172B]31,22 And it was told
[GNSS|172C]Laban on the third day
[GNSS|172D]that Jacob was fled.


[GNSS|172E]31,23 And he took his
[GNSS|172F]brethren with him,
[GNSS|1730]and pursued after him seven
[GNSS|1731]days' journey;


[GNSS|1732]and he overtook him in
[GNSS|1733]the mountain of Gilead.


[GNSS|1734]31,24 And God came to
[GNSS|1735]Laban the Aramean in
[GNSS|1736]a dream of
[GNSS|1737]the night, and
[GNSS|1738]said unto him: 'Take heed
[GNSS|1739]to thyself that thou speak
[GNSS|173A]not to Jacob
[GNSS|173B]either good or bad.' 31,25
[GNSS|173C]And Laban came up
[GNSS|173D]with Jacob.


[GNSS|173E]Now Jacob had
[GNSS|173F]pitched his tent in
[GNSS|1740]the mountain;


[GNSS|1741]and Laban with his brethren
[GNSS|1742]pitched in the mountain
[GNSS|1743]of Gilead.


[GNSS|1744]31,26 And Laban
[GNSS|1745]said to Jacob: 'What hast
[GNSS|1746]thou done, that thou hast
[GNSS|1747]outwitted me, and
[GNSS|1748]carried away my daughters
[GNSS|1749]as though captives
[GNSS|174A]of the sword? 31,27
[GNSS|174B]Wherefore didst thou flee secretly,
[GNSS|174C]and outwit me;
[GNSS|174D]and didst not tell me,
[GNSS|174E]that I might
[GNSS|174F]have sent thee away
[GNSS|1750]with mirth and
[GNSS|1751]with songs, with tabret
[GNSS|1752]and with harp;


[GNSS|1753]31,28 and didst
[GNSS|1754]not suffer me to kiss
[GNSS|1755]my sons and my daughters?
[GNSS|1756]now hast thou done foolishly.


[GNSS|1757]31,29 It is in
[GNSS|1758]the power of my hand
[GNSS|1759]to do you hurt;


[GNSS|175A]but the God
[GNSS|175B]of your father spoke unto
[GNSS|175C]me yesternight, saying: Take heed
[GNSS|175D]to thyself that thou speak
[GNSS|175E]not to Jacob
[GNSS|175F]either good or bad.


[GNSS|1760]31,30 And now that thou
[GNSS|1761]art surely gone,
[GNSS|1762]because thou sore longest
[GNSS|1763]after thy father's house,
[GNSS|1764]wherefore hast thou stolen my
[GNSS|1765]gods?' 31,31 And Jacob
[GNSS|1766]answered and said to Laban:
[GNSS|1767]'Because I was afraid;


[GNSS|1768]for I said:
[GNSS|1769]Lest thou shouldest take thy
[GNSS|176A]daughters from me
[GNSS|176B]by force.


[GNSS|176C]31,32 With whomsoever thou findest
[GNSS|176D]thy gods, he shall
[GNSS|176E]not live;


[GNSS|176F]before our brethren discern thou
[GNSS|1770]what is thine
[GNSS|1771]with me, and take it
[GNSS|1772]to thee.'-For Jacob knew
[GNSS|1773]not that Rachel
[GNSS|1774]had stolen them.- 31,33
[GNSS|1775]And Laban went into Jacob's
[GNSS|1776]tent, and into Leah's tent,
[GNSS|1777]and into the tent
[GNSS|1778]of the two maid-servants;


[GNSS|1779]but he found them not.


[GNSS|177A]And he went out
[GNSS|177B]of Leah's tent,
[GNSS|177C]and entered into Rachel's tent.


[GNSS|177D]31,34 Now Rachel
[GNSS|177E]had taken the teraphim,
[GNSS|177F]and put them in
[GNSS|1780]the saddle of
[GNSS|1781]the camel, and sat upon
[GNSS|1782]them.


[GNSS|1783]And Laban felt about all
[GNSS|1784]the tent, but found them
[GNSS|1785]not.


[GNSS|1786]31,35 And she
[GNSS|1787]said to her father: 'Let
[GNSS|1788]not my lord be angry
[GNSS|1789]that I cannot rise up
[GNSS|178A]before thee;


[GNSS|178B]for the manner
[GNSS|178C]of women is upon me.'
[GNSS|178D]And he searched,
[GNSS|178E]but found not
[GNSS|178F]the teraphim.


[GNSS|1790]31,36 And Jacob was wroth,
[GNSS|1791]and strove with Laban.


[GNSS|1792]And Jacob answered
[GNSS|1793]and said to Laban: 'What
[GNSS|1794]is my trespass?
[GNSS|1795]what is my sin, that
[GNSS|1796]thou hast hotly
[GNSS|1797]pursued after me? 31,37
[GNSS|1798]Whereas thou hast felt about
[GNSS|1799]all my stuff,
[GNSS|179A]what hast thou found
[GNSS|179B]of all thy household stuff?
[GNSS|179C]Set it here
[GNSS|179D]before my brethren
[GNSS|179E]and thy brethren, that they
[GNSS|179F]may judge betwixt us two.


[GNSS|17A0]31,38 These twenty years
[GNSS|17A1]have I been
[GNSS|17A2]with thee;


[GNSS|17A3]thy ewes and thy she-goats
[GNSS|17A4]have not cast their young,
[GNSS|17A5]and the rams
[GNSS|17A6]of thy flocks
[GNSS|17A7]have I not eaten.


[GNSS|17A8]31,39 That which was torn
[GNSS|17A9]of beasts I brought
[GNSS|17AA]not unto thee;


[GNSS|17AB]I bore the loss
[GNSS|17AC]of it; of my hand
[GNSS|17AD]didst thou require it,
[GNSS|17AE]whether stolen by day
[GNSS|17AF]or stolen by night.


[GNSS|17B0]31,40 Thus I was: in
[GNSS|17B1]the day the drought
[GNSS|17B2]consumed me, and
[GNSS|17B3]the frost by night;


[GNSS|17B4]and my sleep fled from
[GNSS|17B5]mine eyes.


[GNSS|17B6]31,41 These twenty years
[GNSS|17B7]have I been in thy
[GNSS|17B8]house: I served thee fourteen
[GNSS|17B9]years for thy two daughters,
[GNSS|17BA]and six years
[GNSS|17BB]for thy flock;


[GNSS|17BC]and thou hast
[GNSS|17BD]changed my wages ten times.


[GNSS|17BE]31,42 Except the God
[GNSS|17BF]of my father,
[GNSS|17C0]the God of Abraham,
[GNSS|17C1]and the Fear
[GNSS|17C2]of Isaac, had been on
[GNSS|17C3]my side, surely
[GNSS|17C4]now hadst thou sent me
[GNSS|17C5]away empty.


[GNSS|17C6]God hath seen mine affliction
[GNSS|17C7]and the labour
[GNSS|17C8]of my hands,
[GNSS|17C9]and gave judgment yesternight.' 31,43
[GNSS|17CA]And Laban answered
[GNSS|17CB]and said unto Jacob: 'The
[GNSS|17CC]daughters are my daughters,
[GNSS|17CD]and the children are my
[GNSS|17CE]children, and the flocks are
[GNSS|17CF]my flocks, and all that
[GNSS|17D0]thou seest is mine;


[GNSS|17D1]and what can I
[GNSS|17D2]do this day
[GNSS|17D3]for these my daughters,
[GNSS|17D4]or for their children
[GNSS|17D5]whom they have borne? 31,44
[GNSS|17D6]And now come, let us
[GNSS|17D7]make a covenant, I
[GNSS|17D8]and thou;


[GNSS|17D9]and let it be
[GNSS|17DA]for a witness between me
[GNSS|17DB]and thee.' 31,45
[GNSS|17DC]And Jacob took
[GNSS|17DD]a stone, and set it
[GNSS|17DE]up for a pillar.


[GNSS|17DF]31,46 And Jacob
[GNSS|17E0]said unto his brethren: 'Gather
[GNSS|17E1]stones';


[GNSS|17E2]and they took stones,
[GNSS|17E3]and made a heap.


[GNSS|17E4]And they did eat there
[GNSS|17E5]by the heap.


[GNSS|17E6]31,47 And Laban
[GNSS|17E7]called it Jegar-sahadutha;


[GNSS|17E8]but Jacob called it Galeed.


[GNSS|17E9]31,48 And Laban said: 'This
[GNSS|17EA]heap is witness between me
[GNSS|17EB]and thee this day.'
[GNSS|17EC]Therefore was the name
[GNSS|17ED]of it called Galeed;


[GNSS|17EE]31,49 and Mizpah,
[GNSS|17EF]for he said: 'The LORD
[GNSS|17F0]watch between me
[GNSS|17F1]and thee, when we are
[GNSS|17F2]absent one from another.


[GNSS|17F3]31,50 If thou shalt afflict
[GNSS|17F4]my daughters, and
[GNSS|17F5]if thou shalt take wives
[GNSS|17F6]beside my daughters,
[GNSS|17F7]no man being
[GNSS|17F8]with us; see, God is
[GNSS|17F9]witness betwixt me
[GNSS|17FA]and thee.' 31,51
[GNSS|17FB]And Laban said to Jacob:
[GNSS|17FC]'Behold this heap,
[GNSS|17FD]and behold the pillar,
[GNSS|17FE]which I have set up
[GNSS|17FF]betwixt me and thee.


[GNSS|1800]31,52 This heap be witness,
[GNSS|1801]and the pillar be witness,
[GNSS|1802]that I will
[GNSS|1803]not pass over this heap
[GNSS|1804]to thee, and that thou
[GNSS|1805]shalt not pass
[GNSS|1806]over this heap
[GNSS|1807]and this pillar unto me,
[GNSS|1808]for harm.


[GNSS|1809]31,53 The God
[GNSS|180A]of Abraham, and
[GNSS|180B]the God of Nahor,
[GNSS|180C]the God of their father,
[GNSS|180D]judge betwixt us.'
[GNSS|180E]And Jacob swore
[GNSS|180F]by the Fear
[GNSS|1810]of his father Isaac.


[GNSS|1811]31,54 And Jacob
[GNSS|1812]offered a sacrifice in
[GNSS|1813]the mountain, and
[GNSS|1814]called his brethren to eat
[GNSS|1815]bread;


[GNSS|1816]and they did eat bread,
[GNSS|1817]and tarried all night in
[GNSS|1818]the mountain.


[GNSS|1819]32,1 And early in
[GNSS|181A]the morning Laban rose up,
[GNSS|181B]and kissed his sons
[GNSS|181C]and his daughters,
[GNSS|181D]and blessed them.


[GNSS|181E]And Laban departed,
[GNSS|181F]and returned unto his place.


[GNSS|1820]32,2 And Jacob
[GNSS|1821]went on his way,
[GNSS|1822]and the angels
[GNSS|1823]of God met him.


[GNSS|1824]32,3 And Jacob
[GNSS|1825]said when he saw them:
[GNSS|1826]'This is God's camp.'
[GNSS|1827]And he called
[GNSS|1828]the name of that place
[GNSS|1829]Mahanaim.


[GNSS|182A]{P}  32,4
[GNSS|182B]And Jacob sent messengers
[GNSS|182C]before him to Esau his
[GNSS|182D]brother unto the land
[GNSS|182E]of Seir, the field
[GNSS|182F]of Edom.


[GNSS|1830]32,5 And he
[GNSS|1831]commanded them, saying: 'Thus shall
[GNSS|1832]ye say unto my lord
[GNSS|1833]Esau: Thus saith thy servant
[GNSS|1834]Jacob: I have
[GNSS|1835]sojourned with Laban,
[GNSS|1836]and stayed until now.


[GNSS|1837]32,6 And I
[GNSS|1838]have oxen, and asses
[GNSS|1839]and flocks, and men-servants
[GNSS|183A]and maid-servants;


[GNSS|183B]and I have sent to
[GNSS|183C]tell my lord, that I
[GNSS|183D]may find favour in thy
[GNSS|183E]sight.' 32,7 And
[GNSS|183F]the messengers returned to Jacob,
[GNSS|1840]saying: 'We came to thy
[GNSS|1841]brother Esau, and moreover he
[GNSS|1842]cometh to meet thee,
[GNSS|1843]and four hundred men
[GNSS|1844]with him.' 32,8
[GNSS|1845]Then Jacob was greatly afraid
[GNSS|1846]and was distressed.


[GNSS|1847]And he divided
[GNSS|1848]the people that was
[GNSS|1849]with him, and
[GNSS|184A]the flocks, and
[GNSS|184B]the herds, and
[GNSS|184C]the camels, into two camps.


[GNSS|184D]32,9 And he said: 'If
[GNSS|184E]Esau come to
[GNSS|184F]the one camp,
[GNSS|1850]and smite it,
[GNSS|1851]then the camp
[GNSS|1852]which is left shall escape.'
[GNSS|1853]32,10 And Jacob said: 'O
[GNSS|1854]God of my father Abraham,
[GNSS|1855]and God of my father
[GNSS|1856]Isaac, O LORD,
[GNSS|1857]who saidst unto me: Return
[GNSS|1858]unto thy country,
[GNSS|1859]and to thy kindred,
[GNSS|185A]and I will
[GNSS|185B]do thee good;


[GNSS|185C]32,11 I am
[GNSS|185D]not worthy of all
[GNSS|185E]the mercies, and
[GNSS|185F]of all the truth,
[GNSS|1860]which Thou hast shown unto
[GNSS|1861]Thy servant;


[GNSS|1862]for with my staff I
[GNSS|1863]passed over this Jordan;


[GNSS|1864]and now I am become
[GNSS|1865]two camps.


[GNSS|1866]32,12 Deliver me, I pray
[GNSS|1867]Thee, from the hand
[GNSS|1868]of my brother, from
[GNSS|1869]the hand of Esau;


[GNSS|186A]for I fear him,
[GNSS|186B]lest he come
[GNSS|186C]and smite me,
[GNSS|186D]the mother with
[GNSS|186E]the children.


[GNSS|186F]32,13 And Thou saidst: I
[GNSS|1870]will surely do thee good,
[GNSS|1871]and make thy seed
[GNSS|1872]as the sand
[GNSS|1873]of the sea,
[GNSS|1874]which cannot be
[GNSS|1875]numbered for multitude.' 32,14
[GNSS|1876]And he lodged there that
[GNSS|1877]night;


[GNSS|1878]and took of that
[GNSS|1879]which he had
[GNSS|187A]with him a
[GNSS|187B]present for Esau his brother:
[GNSS|187C]32,15 two hundred she-goats
[GNSS|187D]and twenty he-goats, two
[GNSS|187E]hundred ewes and twenty rams,
[GNSS|187F]32,16 thirty milch camels
[GNSS|1880]and their colts, forty kine
[GNSS|1881]and ten bulls, twenty she-asses
[GNSS|1882]and ten foals.


[GNSS|1883]32,17 And he
[GNSS|1884]delivered them into
[GNSS|1885]the hand of his servants,
[GNSS|1886]every drove by itself;


[GNSS|1887]and said unto his servants:
[GNSS|1888]'Pass over before me,
[GNSS|1889]and put a space betwixt
[GNSS|188A]drove and drove.' 32,18
[GNSS|188B]And he commanded
[GNSS|188C]the foremost, saying: 'When Esau
[GNSS|188D]my brother meeteth thee,
[GNSS|188E]and asketh thee, saying:
[GNSS|188F]Whose art thou?
[GNSS|1890]and whither goest thou?
[GNSS|1891]and whose are these
[GNSS|1892]before thee? 32,19
[GNSS|1893]then thou shalt say: They
[GNSS|1894]are thy servant Jacob's;


[GNSS|1895]it is a
[GNSS|1896]present sent unto my lord,
[GNSS|1897]even unto Esau;


[GNSS|1898]and, behold, he
[GNSS|1899]also is behind us.' 32,20
[GNSS|189A]And he commanded
[GNSS|189B]also the second,
[GNSS|189C]and the third,
[GNSS|189D]and all that
[GNSS|189E]followed the droves, saying: 'In
[GNSS|189F]this manner shall ye speak
[GNSS|18A0]unto Esau, when ye find
[GNSS|18A1]him;


[GNSS|18A2]32,21 and ye shall say:
[GNSS|18A3]Moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob
[GNSS|18A4]is behind us.'
[GNSS|18A5]For he said: 'I
[GNSS|18A6]will appease him
[GNSS|18A7]with the present that goeth
[GNSS|18A8]before me, and afterward I
[GNSS|18A9]will see his face;


[GNSS|18AA]peradventure he will accept me.'
[GNSS|18AB]32,22 So the
[GNSS|18AC]present passed over
[GNSS|18AD]before him;


[GNSS|18AE]and he himself
[GNSS|18AF]lodged that night in
[GNSS|18B0]the camp.


[GNSS|18B1]32,23 And he rose up
[GNSS|18B2]that night, and took his
[GNSS|18B3]two wives, and his two
[GNSS|18B4]handmaids, and his eleven children,
[GNSS|18B5]and passed over
[GNSS|18B6]the ford of
[GNSS|18B7]the Jabbok.


[GNSS|18B8]32,24 And he took them,
[GNSS|18B9]and sent them
[GNSS|18BA]over the stream,
[GNSS|18BB]and sent over that
[GNSS|18BC]which he had.


[GNSS|18BD]32,25 And Jacob was left
[GNSS|18BE]alone;


[GNSS|18BF]and there wrestled
[GNSS|18C0]a man with him
[GNSS|18C1]until the breaking
[GNSS|18C2]of the day.


[GNSS|18C3]32,26 And when he saw
[GNSS|18C4]that he prevailed
[GNSS|18C5]not against him, he
[GNSS|18C6]touched the hollow
[GNSS|18C7]of his thigh;


[GNSS|18C8]and the hollow
[GNSS|18C9]of Jacob's thigh was strained,
[GNSS|18CA]as he wrestled
[GNSS|18CB]with him.


[GNSS|18CC]32,27 And he said: 'Let
[GNSS|18CD]me go, for
[GNSS|18CE]the day breaketh.'
[GNSS|18CF]And he said: 'I
[GNSS|18D0]will not let thee go,
[GNSS|18D1]except thou bless me.' 32,28
[GNSS|18D2]And he said unto him:
[GNSS|18D3]'What is thy name?'
[GNSS|18D4]And he said: 'Jacob.' 32,29
[GNSS|18D5]And he said: 'Thy name
[GNSS|18D6]shall be called
[GNSS|18D7]no more Jacob,
[GNSS|18D8]but Israel;


[GNSS|18D9]for thou hast striven
[GNSS|18DA]with God and
[GNSS|18DB]with men, and hast prevailed.'
[GNSS|18DC]32,30 And Jacob
[GNSS|18DD]asked him, and said: 'Tell
[GNSS|18DE]me, I pray thee, thy
[GNSS|18DF]name.' And he said: 'Wherefore
[GNSS|18E0]is it that thou dost
[GNSS|18E1]ask after my name?'
[GNSS|18E2]And he blessed him there.


[GNSS|18E3]32,31 And Jacob
[GNSS|18E4]called the name
[GNSS|18E5]of the place Peniel: 'for
[GNSS|18E6]I have seen God face
[GNSS|18E7]to face, and my life
[GNSS|18E8]is preserved.' 32,32
[GNSS|18E9]And the sun rose upon
[GNSS|18EA]him as he
[GNSS|18EB]passed over Peniel,
[GNSS|18EC]and he limped upon his
[GNSS|18ED]thigh.


[GNSS|18EE]32,33 Therefore the children
[GNSS|18EF]of Israel eat
[GNSS|18F0]not the sinew
[GNSS|18F1]of the thigh-vein
[GNSS|18F2]which is upon
[GNSS|18F3]the hollow of
[GNSS|18F4]the thigh, unto this day;


[GNSS|18F5]because he touched
[GNSS|18F6]the hollow of Jacob's thigh,
[GNSS|18F7]even in the sinew
[GNSS|18F8]of the thigh-vein.


[GNSS|18F9]33,1 And Jacob
[GNSS|18FA]lifted up his eyes
[GNSS|18FB]and looked, and, behold, Esau
[GNSS|18FC]came, and with him four
[GNSS|18FD]hundred men.


[GNSS|18FE]And he divided
[GNSS|18FF]the children unto Leah,
[GNSS|1900]and unto Rachel,
[GNSS|1901]and unto the two handmaids.


[GNSS|1902]33,2 And he put
[GNSS|1903]the handmaids and their children
[GNSS|1904]foremost, and Leah
[GNSS|1905]and her children after,
[GNSS|1906]and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.


[GNSS|1907]33,3 And he himself
[GNSS|1908]passed over before them,
[GNSS|1909]and bowed himself to
[GNSS|190A]the ground seven times,
[GNSS|190B]until he came near to
[GNSS|190C]his brother.


[GNSS|190D]33,4 And Esau ran to
[GNSS|190E]meet him, and
[GNSS|190F]embraced him, and fell on
[GNSS|1910]his neck, and
[GNSS|1911]kissed him;


[GNSS|1912]and they wept.


[GNSS|1913]33,5 And he
[GNSS|1914]lifted up his eyes,
[GNSS|1915]and saw the women
[GNSS|1916]and the children;


[GNSS|1917]and said: 'Who are these
[GNSS|1918]with thee?' And he said:
[GNSS|1919]'The children whom God hath
[GNSS|191A]graciously given thy servant.' 33,6
[GNSS|191B]Then the handmaids came near,
[GNSS|191C]they and their children,
[GNSS|191D]and they bowed down.


[GNSS|191E]33,7 And Leah
[GNSS|191F]also and her children came
[GNSS|1920]near, and bowed down;


[GNSS|1921]and after came Joseph near
[GNSS|1922]and Rachel, and they
[GNSS|1923]bowed down.


[GNSS|1924]33,8 And he said: 'What
[GNSS|1925]meanest thou by all this
[GNSS|1926]camp which I met?'
[GNSS|1927]And he said: 'To find
[GNSS|1928]favour in the sight
[GNSS|1929]of my lord.' 33,9
[GNSS|192A]And Esau said: 'I
[GNSS|192B]have enough;


[GNSS|192C]my brother, let that
[GNSS|192D]which thou hast be thine.'
[GNSS|192E]33,10 And Jacob said: 'Nay,
[GNSS|192F]I pray thee,
[GNSS|1930]if now I
[GNSS|1931]have found favour in thy
[GNSS|1932]sight, then receive my
[GNSS|1933]present at my hand;


[GNSS|1934]forasmuch as I
[GNSS|1935]have seen thy face,
[GNSS|1936]as one seeth
[GNSS|1937]the face of God,
[GNSS|1938]and thou wast
[GNSS|1939]pleased with me. 33,11 Take,
[GNSS|193A]I pray thee, my gift
[GNSS|193B]that is brought to thee;


[GNSS|193C]because God hath dealt graciously
[GNSS|193D]with me, and
[GNSS|193E]because I have enough.'
[GNSS|193F]And he urged him,
[GNSS|1940]and he took it. 33,12
[GNSS|1941]And he said: 'Let us
[GNSS|1942]take our journey,
[GNSS|1943]and let us go,
[GNSS|1944]and I will
[GNSS|1945]go before thee.' 33,13
[GNSS|1946]And he said unto him:
[GNSS|1947]'My lord knoweth that
[GNSS|1948]the children are tender,
[GNSS|1949]and that the flocks
[GNSS|194A]and herds giving suck are
[GNSS|194B]a care to me;
[GNSS|194C]and if they overdrive them
[GNSS|194D]one day, all
[GNSS|194E]the flocks will die.


[GNSS|194F]33,14 Let my lord, I
[GNSS|1950]pray thee, pass
[GNSS|1951]over before his servant;


[GNSS|1952]and I will journey on
[GNSS|1953]gently, according to
[GNSS|1954]the pace of
[GNSS|1955]the cattle that are
[GNSS|1956]before me and
[GNSS|1957]according to the pace
[GNSS|1958]of the children,
[GNSS|1959]until I come unto my
[GNSS|195A]lord unto Seir.' 33,15
[GNSS|195B]And Esau said: 'Let me
[GNSS|195C]now leave with thee some
[GNSS|195D]of the folk that are
[GNSS|195E]with me.' And he said:
[GNSS|195F]'What needeth it? let me
[GNSS|1960]find favour in
[GNSS|1961]the sight of my lord.'
[GNSS|1962]33,16 So Esau
[GNSS|1963]returned that day on his
[GNSS|1964]way unto Seir.


[GNSS|1965]33,17 And Jacob
[GNSS|1966]journeyed to Succoth,
[GNSS|1967]and built him
[GNSS|1968]a house, and
[GNSS|1969]made booths for his cattle.


[GNSS|196A]Therefore the name
[GNSS|196B]of the place is
[GNSS|196C]called Succoth.


[GNSS|196D]{S} 33,18 And Jacob came
[GNSS|196E]in peace to
[GNSS|196F]the city of Shechem,
[GNSS|1970]which is in
[GNSS|1971]the land of Canaan,
[GNSS|1972]when he came from Paddan-aram;


[GNSS|1973]and encamped before
[GNSS|1974]the city.


[GNSS|1975]33,19 And he bought
[GNSS|1976]the parcel of ground,
[GNSS|1977]where he had spread his
[GNSS|1978]tent, at the hand
[GNSS|1979]of the children
[GNSS|197A]of Hamor, Shechem's father,
[GNSS|197B]for a hundred pieces
[GNSS|197C]of money.


[GNSS|197D]33,20 And he
[GNSS|197E]erected there an altar,
[GNSS|197F]and called it El-elohe-Israel.


[GNSS|1980]{S} 34,1 And Dinah
[GNSS|1981]the daughter of Leah,
[GNSS|1982]whom she had borne unto
[GNSS|1983]Jacob, went out to see
[GNSS|1984]the daughters of
[GNSS|1985]the land.


[GNSS|1986]34,2 And Shechem
[GNSS|1987]the son of Hamor
[GNSS|1988]the Hivite, the prince
[GNSS|1989]of the land, saw her;


[GNSS|198A]and he took her,
[GNSS|198B]and lay with her,
[GNSS|198C]and humbled her.


[GNSS|198D]34,3 And his soul did
[GNSS|198E]cleave unto Dinah
[GNSS|198F]the daughter of Jacob,
[GNSS|1990]and he loved
[GNSS|1991]the damsel, and spoke comfortingly
[GNSS|1992]unto the damsel.


[GNSS|1993]34,4 And Shechem spoke unto
[GNSS|1994]his father Hamor, saying: 'Get
[GNSS|1995]me this damsel to wife.'
[GNSS|1996]34,5 Now Jacob heard that
[GNSS|1997]he had defiled Dinah his
[GNSS|1998]daughter;


[GNSS|1999]and his sons were
[GNSS|199A]with his cattle in
[GNSS|199B]the field;


[GNSS|199C]and Jacob held his peace
[GNSS|199D]until they came.


[GNSS|199E]34,6 And Hamor
[GNSS|199F]the father of Shechem
[GNSS|19A0]went out unto Jacob to
[GNSS|19A1]speak with him.


[GNSS|19A2]34,7 And the sons
[GNSS|19A3]of Jacob came in from
[GNSS|19A4]the field when they heard
[GNSS|19A5]it; and the men were
[GNSS|19A6]grieved, and they were very
[GNSS|19A7]wroth, because he
[GNSS|19A8]had wrought a vile deed
[GNSS|19A9]in Israel in
[GNSS|19AA]lying with Jacob's daughter;


[GNSS|19AB]which thing ought
[GNSS|19AC]not to be done.


[GNSS|19AD]34,8 And Hamor spoke
[GNSS|19AE]with them, saying 'The soul
[GNSS|19AF]of my son Shechem longeth
[GNSS|19B0]for your daughter.


[GNSS|19B1]I pray you give her
[GNSS|19B2]unto him to wife.


[GNSS|19B3]34,9 And make ye marriages
[GNSS|19B4]with us; give your daughters
[GNSS|19B5]unto us, and take our
[GNSS|19B6]daughters unto you.


[GNSS|19B7]34,10 And ye shall dwell
[GNSS|19B8]with us; and
[GNSS|19B9]the land shall be
[GNSS|19BA]before you;


[GNSS|19BB]dwell and trade ye therein,
[GNSS|19BC]and get you possessions therein.'
[GNSS|19BD]34,11 And Shechem
[GNSS|19BE]said unto her father
[GNSS|19BF]and unto her brethren: 'Let
[GNSS|19C0]me find favour in your
[GNSS|19C1]eyes, and what ye shall
[GNSS|19C2]say unto me I
[GNSS|19C3]will give.


[GNSS|19C4]34,12 Ask me
[GNSS|19C5]never so much dowry
[GNSS|19C6]and gift, and I
[GNSS|19C7]will give according
[GNSS|19C8]as ye shall
[GNSS|19C9]say unto me;
[GNSS|19CA]but give me
[GNSS|19CB]the damsel to wife.' 34,13
[GNSS|19CC]And the sons
[GNSS|19CD]of Jacob answered Shechem
[GNSS|19CE]and Hamor his father
[GNSS|19CF]with guile, and spoke,
[GNSS|19D0]because he had
[GNSS|19D1]defiled Dinah their sister, 34,14
[GNSS|19D2]and said unto them: 'We
[GNSS|19D3]cannot do this thing, to
[GNSS|19D4]give our sister to one
[GNSS|19D5]that is uncircumcised;


[GNSS|19D6]for that were
[GNSS|19D7]a reproach unto us. 34,15
[GNSS|19D8]Only on this condition
[GNSS|19D9]will we consent unto you:
[GNSS|19DA]if ye will be
[GNSS|19DB]as we are, that every
[GNSS|19DC]male of you be circumcised;


[GNSS|19DD]34,16 then will we give
[GNSS|19DE]our daughters unto you,
[GNSS|19DF]and we will take your
[GNSS|19E0]daughters to us,
[GNSS|19E1]and we will dwell
[GNSS|19E2]with you, and we
[GNSS|19E3]will become one people.


[GNSS|19E4]34,17 But if ye
[GNSS|19E5]will not hearken unto us,
[GNSS|19E6]to be circumcised;


[GNSS|19E7]then will we take our
[GNSS|19E8]daughter, and we
[GNSS|19E9]will be gone.' 34,18
[GNSS|19EA]And their words
[GNSS|19EB]pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's
[GNSS|19EC]son.


[GNSS|19ED]34,19 And the young man
[GNSS|19EE]deferred not to
[GNSS|19EF]do the thing,
[GNSS|19F0]because he had delight in
[GNSS|19F1]Jacob's daughter.


[GNSS|19F2]And he was
[GNSS|19F3]honoured above all
[GNSS|19F4]the house of his father.


[GNSS|19F5]34,20 And Hamor
[GNSS|19F6]and Shechem his son came
[GNSS|19F7]unto the gate
[GNSS|19F8]of their city,
[GNSS|19F9]and spoke with
[GNSS|19FA]the men of their city,
[GNSS|19FB]saying: 34,21 'These men are
[GNSS|19FC]peaceable with us;
[GNSS|19FD]therefore let them dwell in
[GNSS|19FE]the land, and trade therein;


[GNSS|19FF]for, behold, the land is
[GNSS|1A00]large enough for them;


[GNSS|1A01]let us take their daughters
[GNSS|1A02]to us for wives,
[GNSS|1A03]and let us give them
[GNSS|1A04]our daughters.


[GNSS|1A05]34,22 Only on this condition
[GNSS|1A06]will the men consent unto
[GNSS|1A07]us to dwell
[GNSS|1A08]with us, to become one
[GNSS|1A09]people, if every male among
[GNSS|1A0A]us be circumcised,
[GNSS|1A0B]as they are circumcised.


[GNSS|1A0C]34,23 Shall not their cattle
[GNSS|1A0D]and their substance
[GNSS|1A0E]and all their beasts be
[GNSS|1A0F]ours? only let us consent
[GNSS|1A10]unto them, and they
[GNSS|1A11]will dwell with us.' 34,24
[GNSS|1A12]And unto Hamor
[GNSS|1A13]and unto Shechem his son
[GNSS|1A14]hearkened all that
[GNSS|1A15]went out of
[GNSS|1A16]the gate of his city;


[GNSS|1A17]and every male was circumcised,
[GNSS|1A18]all that went out
[GNSS|1A19]of the gate
[GNSS|1A1A]of his city.


[GNSS|1A1B]34,25 And it came to
[GNSS|1A1C]pass on the third day,
[GNSS|1A1D]when they were in pain,
[GNSS|1A1E]that two of
[GNSS|1A1F]the sons of Jacob, Simeon
[GNSS|1A20]and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took
[GNSS|1A21]each man his sword,
[GNSS|1A22]and came upon
[GNSS|1A23]the city unawares,
[GNSS|1A24]and slew all
[GNSS|1A25]the males.


[GNSS|1A26]34,26 And they slew Hamor
[GNSS|1A27]and Shechem his son
[GNSS|1A28]with the edge
[GNSS|1A29]of the sword,
[GNSS|1A2A]and took Dinah out
[GNSS|1A2B]of Shechem's house,
[GNSS|1A2C]and went forth.


[GNSS|1A2D]34,27 The sons
[GNSS|1A2E]of Jacob came upon
[GNSS|1A2F]the slain, and
[GNSS|1A30]spoiled the city,
[GNSS|1A31]because they had
[GNSS|1A32]defiled their sister.


[GNSS|1A33]34,28 They took their flocks
[GNSS|1A34]and their herds
[GNSS|1A35]and their asses,
[GNSS|1A36]and that which was in
[GNSS|1A37]the city and that
[GNSS|1A38]which was in
[GNSS|1A39]the field;


[GNSS|1A3A]34,29 and all their wealth,
[GNSS|1A3B]and all their little ones
[GNSS|1A3C]and their wives, took they
[GNSS|1A3D]captive and spoiled,
[GNSS|1A3E]even all that was in
[GNSS|1A3F]the house.


[GNSS|1A40]34,30 And Jacob
[GNSS|1A41]said to Simeon
[GNSS|1A42]and Levi: 'Ye
[GNSS|1A43]have troubled me, to
[GNSS|1A44]make me odious unto
[GNSS|1A45]the inhabitants of
[GNSS|1A46]the land, even unto
[GNSS|1A47]the Canaanites and
[GNSS|1A48]the Perizzites;


[GNSS|1A49]and, I being
[GNSS|1A4A]few in number, they
[GNSS|1A4B]will gather themselves together against
[GNSS|1A4C]me and smite me;
[GNSS|1A4D]and I shall be destroyed,
[GNSS|1A4E]I and my house.' 34,31
[GNSS|1A4F]And they said: 'Should one
[GNSS|1A50]deal with our sister
[GNSS|1A51]as with a harlot?' {P}
[GNSS|1A52]35,1 And God
[GNSS|1A53]said unto Jacob: 'Arise,
[GNSS|1A54]go up to Beth-el,
[GNSS|1A55]and dwell there;


[GNSS|1A56]and make there an altar
[GNSS|1A57]unto God, who
[GNSS|1A58]appeared unto thee
[GNSS|1A59]when thou didst flee from
[GNSS|1A5A]the face of Esau thy
[GNSS|1A5B]brother.' 35,2 Then Jacob
[GNSS|1A5C]said unto his household,
[GNSS|1A5D]and to all that were
[GNSS|1A5E]with him: 'Put away
[GNSS|1A5F]the strange gods that are
[GNSS|1A60]among you, and purify yourselves,
[GNSS|1A61]and change your garments;


[GNSS|1A62]35,3 and let us arise,
[GNSS|1A63]and go up to Beth-el;


[GNSS|1A64]and I will
[GNSS|1A65]make there an altar unto
[GNSS|1A66]God, who answered me in
[GNSS|1A67]the day of my distress,
[GNSS|1A68]and was with me in
[GNSS|1A69]the way which I went.'
[GNSS|1A6A]35,4 And they gave unto
[GNSS|1A6B]Jacob all the foreign gods
[GNSS|1A6C]which were in their hand,
[GNSS|1A6D]and the rings
[GNSS|1A6E]which were in their ears;


[GNSS|1A6F]and Jacob hid them under
[GNSS|1A70]the terebinth which was
[GNSS|1A71]by Shechem.


[GNSS|1A72]35,5 And they journeyed;


[GNSS|1A73]and a terror
[GNSS|1A74]of God was upon
[GNSS|1A75]the cities that were round
[GNSS|1A76]about them, and they did
[GNSS|1A77]not pursue after
[GNSS|1A78]the sons of Jacob.


[GNSS|1A79]35,6 So Jacob came to
[GNSS|1A7A]Luz, which is in
[GNSS|1A7B]the land of Canaan-the same
[GNSS|1A7C]is Beth-el-he and all
[GNSS|1A7D]the people that were
[GNSS|1A7E]with him.


[GNSS|1A7F]35,7 And he built there
[GNSS|1A80]an altar, and
[GNSS|1A81]called the place El-beth-el,
[GNSS|1A82]because there God was
[GNSS|1A83]revealed unto him,
[GNSS|1A84]when he fled from
[GNSS|1A85]the face of his brother.


[GNSS|1A86]35,8 And Deborah Rebekah's nurse
[GNSS|1A87]died, and she was
[GNSS|1A88]buried below Beth-el under
[GNSS|1A89]the oak;


[GNSS|1A8A]and the name
[GNSS|1A8B]of it was
[GNSS|1A8C]called Allon-bacuth.


[GNSS|1A8D]{P}  35,9
[GNSS|1A8E]And God appeared unto Jacob
[GNSS|1A8F]again, when he came from
[GNSS|1A90]Paddan-aram, and blessed him.


[GNSS|1A91]35,10 And God
[GNSS|1A92]said unto him: 'Thy name
[GNSS|1A93]is Jacob: thy name shall
[GNSS|1A94]not be called any
[GNSS|1A95]more Jacob, but Israel shall
[GNSS|1A96]be thy name';


[GNSS|1A97]and He called his name
[GNSS|1A98]Israel.


[GNSS|1A99]35,11 And God
[GNSS|1A9A]said unto him: 'I am
[GNSS|1A9B]God Almighty.


[GNSS|1A9C]Be fruitful and multiply;


[GNSS|1A9D]a nation and
[GNSS|1A9E]a company of nations shall
[GNSS|1A9F]be of thee,
[GNSS|1AA0]and kings shall come out
[GNSS|1AA1]of thy loins;


[GNSS|1AA2]35,12 and the land
[GNSS|1AA3]which I gave unto Abraham
[GNSS|1AA4]and Isaac, to thee I
[GNSS|1AA5]will give it,
[GNSS|1AA6]and to thy seed
[GNSS|1AA7]after thee will I give
[GNSS|1AA8]the land.' 35,13
[GNSS|1AA9]And God went up from
[GNSS|1AAA]him in the place
[GNSS|1AAB]where He spoke
[GNSS|1AAC]with him.


[GNSS|1AAD]35,14 And Jacob set up
[GNSS|1AAE]a pillar in
[GNSS|1AAF]the place where He spoke
[GNSS|1AB0]with him, a pillar
[GNSS|1AB1]of stone, and he
[GNSS|1AB2]poured out a
[GNSS|1AB3]drink-offering thereon, and
[GNSS|1AB4]poured oil thereon.


[GNSS|1AB5]35,15 And Jacob
[GNSS|1AB6]called the name
[GNSS|1AB7]of the place
[GNSS|1AB8]where God spoke
[GNSS|1AB9]with him, Beth-el.


[GNSS|1ABA]35,16 And they
[GNSS|1ABB]journeyed from Beth-el;


[GNSS|1ABC]and there was
[GNSS|1ABD]still some way to come
[GNSS|1ABE]to Ephrath;


[GNSS|1ABF]and Rachel travailed,
[GNSS|1AC0]and she had hard labour.


[GNSS|1AC1]35,17 And it came to
[GNSS|1AC2]pass, when she was in
[GNSS|1AC3]hard labour, that
[GNSS|1AC4]the mid-wife said unto her:
[GNSS|1AC5]'Fear not;


[GNSS|1AC6]for this also is
[GNSS|1AC7]a son for thee.' 35,18
[GNSS|1AC8]And it came to pass,
[GNSS|1AC9]as her soul was in
[GNSS|1ACA]departing-for she died-that she
[GNSS|1ACB]called his name Ben-oni;


[GNSS|1ACC]but his father
[GNSS|1ACD]called him Benjamin.


[GNSS|1ACE]35,19 And Rachel died,
[GNSS|1ACF]and was buried in
[GNSS|1AD0]the way to Ephrath-the same
[GNSS|1AD1]is Beth-lehem.


[GNSS|1AD2]35,20 And Jacob set up
[GNSS|1AD3]a pillar upon her grave;


[GNSS|1AD4]the same is
[GNSS|1AD5]the pillar of Rachel's grave
[GNSS|1AD6]unto this day.


[GNSS|1AD7]35,21 And Israel journeyed,
[GNSS|1AD8]and spread his tent beyond
[GNSS|1AD9]Migdal-eder.


[GNSS|1ADA]35,22 And it came to
[GNSS|1ADB]pass, while Israel dwelt in
[GNSS|1ADC]that land, that Reuben
[GNSS|1ADD]went and lay
[GNSS|1ADE]with Bilhah his father's concubine;


[GNSS|1ADF]and Israel heard
[GNSS|1AE0]of it. {P}
[GNSS|1AE1]Now the sons
[GNSS|1AE2]of Jacob were twelve: 35,23
[GNSS|1AE3]the sons of Leah: Reuben,
[GNSS|1AE4]Jacob's first-born, and Simeon,
[GNSS|1AE5]and Levi, and Judah,
[GNSS|1AE6]and Issachar, and Zebulun;


[GNSS|1AE7]35,24 the sons
[GNSS|1AE8]of Rachel: Joseph
[GNSS|1AE9]and Benjamin;


[GNSS|1AEA]35,25 and the sons
[GNSS|1AEB]of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid: Dan
[GNSS|1AEC]and Naphtali;


[GNSS|1AED]35,26 and the sons
[GNSS|1AEE]of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad
[GNSS|1AEF]and Asher.


[GNSS|1AF0]These are the sons
[GNSS|1AF1]of Jacob, that were born
[GNSS|1AF2]to him in Paddan-aram.


[GNSS|1AF3]35,27 And Jacob came unto
[GNSS|1AF4]Isaac his father to Mamre,
[GNSS|1AF5]to Kiriatharba-the same is Hebron-where
[GNSS|1AF6]Abraham and Isaac sojourned.


[GNSS|1AF7]35,28 And the days
[GNSS|1AF8]of Isaac were
[GNSS|1AF9]a hundred and fourscore years.


[GNSS|1AFA]35,29 And Isaac expired,
[GNSS|1AFB]and died, and was
[GNSS|1AFC]gathered unto his people, old
[GNSS|1AFD]and full of days;


[GNSS|1AFE]and Esau and Jacob his
[GNSS|1AFF]sons buried him.


[GNSS|1B00]{P}  36,1
[GNSS|1B01]Now these are
[GNSS|1B02]the generations of Esau-the same
[GNSS|1B03]is Edom.


[GNSS|1B04]36,2 Esau took his wives
[GNSS|1B05]of the daughters
[GNSS|1B06]of Canaan;


[GNSS|1B07]Adah the daughter
[GNSS|1B08]of Elon the Hittite,
[GNSS|1B09]and Oholibamah the daughter
[GNSS|1B0A]of Anah, the daughter
[GNSS|1B0B]of Zibeon the Hivite, 36,3
[GNSS|1B0C]and Basemath Ishmael's daughter, sister
[GNSS|1B0D]of Nebaioth.


[GNSS|1B0E]36,4 And Adah bore to
[GNSS|1B0F]Esau Eliphaz;


[GNSS|1B10]and Basemath bore Reuel;


[GNSS|1B11]36,5 and Oholibamah bore Jeush,
[GNSS|1B12]and Jalam, and Korah.


[GNSS|1B13]These are the sons
[GNSS|1B14]of Esau, that were born
[GNSS|1B15]unto him in
[GNSS|1B16]the land of Canaan.


[GNSS|1B17]36,6 And Esau took his
[GNSS|1B18]wives, and his sons,
[GNSS|1B19]and his daughters,
[GNSS|1B1A]and all the souls
[GNSS|1B1B]of his house,
[GNSS|1B1C]and his cattle,
[GNSS|1B1D]and all his beasts,
[GNSS|1B1E]and all his possessions,
[GNSS|1B1F]which he had
[GNSS|1B20]gathered in the land
[GNSS|1B21]of Canaan;


[GNSS|1B22]and went into
[GNSS|1B23]a land away from his
[GNSS|1B24]brother Jacob.


[GNSS|1B25]36,7 For their substance was
[GNSS|1B26]too great for them to
[GNSS|1B27]dwell together;


[GNSS|1B28]and the land
[GNSS|1B29]of their sojournings
[GNSS|1B2A]could not bear them
[GNSS|1B2B]because of their cattle.


[GNSS|1B2C]36,8 And Esau dwelt in
[GNSS|1B2D]the mountain-land of Seir-Esau is

[GNSS|1C03]the Edomites.


[GNSS|1C04]{P}  37,1
[GNSS|1C05]And Jacob dwelt in
[GNSS|1C06]the land of his father's
[GNSS|1C07]sojournings, in the land
[GNSS|1C08]of Canaan.


[GNSS|1C09]37,2 These are
[GNSS|1C0A]the generations of Jacob.


[GNSS|1C0B]Joseph, being seventeen years old,
[GNSS|1C0C]was feeding the flock
[GNSS|1C0D]with his brethren,
[GNSS|1C0E]being still a lad
[GNSS|1C0F]even with the sons
[GNSS|1C10]of Bilhah, and
[GNSS|1C11]with the sons
[GNSS|1C12]of Zilpah, his father's wives;


[GNSS|1C13]and Joseph brought evil report
[GNSS|1C14]of them unto their father.


[GNSS|1C15]37,3 Now Israel
[GNSS|1C16]loved Joseph more
[GNSS|1C17]than all his children,
[GNSS|1C18]because he was
[GNSS|1C19]the son of his old
[GNSS|1C1A]age;


[GNSS|1C1B]and he made him
[GNSS|1C1C]a coat of many colours.


[GNSS|1C1D]37,4 And when his brethren
[GNSS|1C1E]saw that their father
[GNSS|1C1F]loved him more
[GNSS|1C20]than all his brethren, they
[GNSS|1C21]hated him, and
[GNSS|1C22]could not speak peaceably unto
[GNSS|1C23]him.


[GNSS|1C24]37,5 And Joseph
[GNSS|1C25]dreamed a dream,
[GNSS|1C26]and he told it to
[GNSS|1C27]his brethren;


[GNSS|1C28]and they hated him
[GNSS|1C29]yet the more.


[GNSS|1C2A]37,6 And he
[GNSS|1C2B]said unto them: 'Hear, I
[GNSS|1C2C]pray you, this dream
[GNSS|1C2D]which I have dreamed: 37,7
[GNSS|1C2E]for, behold, we were
[GNSS|1C2F]binding sheaves in
[GNSS|1C30]the field, and, lo, my
[GNSS|1C31]sheaf arose, and
[GNSS|1C32]also stood upright;


[GNSS|1C33]and, behold, your sheaves came
[GNSS|1C34]round about, and
[GNSS|1C35]bowed down to my sheaf.'
[GNSS|1C36]37,8 And his brethren
[GNSS|1C37]said to him: 'Shalt thou
[GNSS|1C38]indeed reign over us?
[GNSS|1C39]or shalt thou
[GNSS|1C3A]indeed have dominion
[GNSS|1C3B]over us?' And they
[GNSS|1C3C]hated him yet
[GNSS|1C3D]the more for his dreams,
[GNSS|1C3E]and for his words.


[GNSS|1C3F]37,9 And he
[GNSS|1C40]dreamed yet another dream,
[GNSS|1C41]and told it to his
[GNSS|1C42]brethren, and said: 'Behold, I
[GNSS|1C43]have dreamed yet
[GNSS|1C44]a dream: and, behold,
[GNSS|1C45]the sun and
[GNSS|1C46]the moon and eleven stars
[GNSS|1C47]bowed down to me.' 37,10
[GNSS|1C48]And he told it to
[GNSS|1C49]his father, and to his
[GNSS|1C4A]brethren;


[GNSS|1C4B]and his father
[GNSS|1C4C]rebuked him, and
[GNSS|1C4D]said unto him: 'What is
[GNSS|1C4E]this dream that thou hast
[GNSS|1C4F]dreamed? Shall I
[GNSS|1C50]and thy mother
[GNSS|1C51]and thy brethren
[GNSS|1C52]indeed come to bow down
[GNSS|1C53]to thee to
[GNSS|1C54]the earth?' 37,11
[GNSS|1C55]And his brethren
[GNSS|1C56]envied him;


[GNSS|1C57]but his father kept
[GNSS|1C58]the saying in mind.


[GNSS|1C59]37,12 And his brethren
[GNSS|1C5A]went to feed their father's
[GNSS|1C5B]flock in Shechem.


[GNSS|1C5C]37,13 And Israel
[GNSS|1C5D]said unto Joseph: 'Do
[GNSS|1C5E]not thy brethren feed
[GNSS|1C5F]the flock in Shechem? come,
[GNSS|1C60]and I will send thee
[GNSS|1C61]unto them.' And he
[GNSS|1C62]said to him: 'Here am
[GNSS|1C63]I.' 37,14 And he
[GNSS|1C64]said to him: 'Go now,
[GNSS|1C65]see whether it is well
[GNSS|1C66]with thy brethren,
[GNSS|1C67]and well with
[GNSS|1C68]the flock;


[GNSS|1C69]and bring me back word.'
[GNSS|1C6A]So he sent him out
[GNSS|1C6B]of the vale
[GNSS|1C6C]of Hebron, and he came
[GNSS|1C6D]to Shechem.


[GNSS|1C6E]37,15 And a certain man
[GNSS|1C6F]found him, and, behold, he
[GNSS|1C70]was wandering in
[GNSS|1C71]the field.


[GNSS|1C72]And the man
[GNSS|1C73]asked him, saying: 'What seekest
[GNSS|1C74]thou?' 37,16 And he said:
[GNSS|1C75]'I seek my brethren.


[GNSS|1C76]Tell me, I pray thee,
[GNSS|1C77]where they are
[GNSS|1C78]feeding the flock.' 37,17
[GNSS|1C79]And the man said: 'They
[GNSS|1C7A]are departed hence;


[GNSS|1C7B]for I heard them say:
[GNSS|1C7C]Let us go to Dothan.'
[GNSS|1C7D]And Joseph went
[GNSS|1C7E]after his brethren,
[GNSS|1C7F]and found them in Dothan.


[GNSS|1C80]37,18 And they saw him
[GNSS|1C81]afar off, and
[GNSS|1C82]before he came near unto
[GNSS|1C83]them, they conspired against him
[GNSS|1C84]to slay him.


[GNSS|1C85]37,19 And they
[GNSS|1C86]said one to another: 'Behold,
[GNSS|1C87]this dreamer cometh.


[GNSS|1C88]37,20 Come now therefore,
[GNSS|1C89]and let us slay him,
[GNSS|1C8A]and cast him into one
[GNSS|1C8B]of the pits,
[GNSS|1C8C]and we will say: An
[GNSS|1C8D]evil beast hath
[GNSS|1C8E]devoured him;


[GNSS|1C8F]and we shall see
[GNSS|1C90]what will become
[GNSS|1C91]of his dreams.' 37,21
[GNSS|1C92]And Reuben heard it,
[GNSS|1C93]and delivered him out
[GNSS|1C94]of their hand;


[GNSS|1C95]and said: 'Let us
[GNSS|1C96]not take his life.' 37,22
[GNSS|1C97]And Reuben said unto them:
[GNSS|1C98]'Shed no blood;


[GNSS|1C99]cast him into this pit
[GNSS|1C9A]that is in
[GNSS|1C9B]the wilderness, but lay
[GNSS|1C9C]no hand upon him'-that he
[GNSS|1C9D]might deliver him out
[GNSS|1C9E]of their hand, to restore
[GNSS|1C9F]him to his father.


[GNSS|1CA0]37,23 And it came to
[GNSS|1CA1]pass, when Joseph was come
[GNSS|1CA2]unto his brethren, that they
[GNSS|1CA3]stripped Joseph of his coat,
[GNSS|1CA4]the coat of many colours
[GNSS|1CA5]that was on him;


[GNSS|1CA6]37,24 and they took him,
[GNSS|1CA7]and cast him into
[GNSS|1CA8]the pit-and the pit was
[GNSS|1CA9]empty, there was
[GNSS|1CAA]no water in it. 37,25
[GNSS|1CAB]And they sat down to
[GNSS|1CAC]eat bread;


[GNSS|1CAD]and they lifted up their
[GNSS|1CAE]eyes and looked, and, behold,
[GNSS|1CAF]a caravan of Ishmaelites came
[GNSS|1CB0]from Gilead, with their camels
[GNSS|1CB1]bearing spicery and balm
[GNSS|1CB2]and ladanum, going to carry
[GNSS|1CB3]it down to Egypt.


[GNSS|1CB4]37,26 And Judah
[GNSS|1CB5]said unto his brethren: 'What
[GNSS|1CB6]profit is it
[GNSS|1CB7]if we slay our brother
[GNSS|1CB8]and conceal his blood? 37,27
[GNSS|1CB9]Come, and let us sell
[GNSS|1CBA]him to the Ishmaelites,
[GNSS|1CBB]and let not our hand
[GNSS|1CBC]be upon him;


[GNSS|1CBD]for he is our brother,
[GNSS|1CBE]our flesh.' And his brethren
[GNSS|1CBF]hearkened unto him.


[GNSS|1CC0]37,28 And there
[GNSS|1CC1]passed by Midianites, merchantmen;


[GNSS|1CC2]and they drew
[GNSS|1CC3]and lifted up Joseph out
[GNSS|1CC4]of the pit,
[GNSS|1CC5]and sold Joseph to
[GNSS|1CC6]the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels
[GNSS|1CC7]of silver.


[GNSS|1CC8]And they brought Joseph into
[GNSS|1CC9]Egypt.


[GNSS|1CCA]37,29 And Reuben
[GNSS|1CCB]returned unto the pit;


[GNSS|1CCC]and, behold, Joseph was
[GNSS|1CCD]not in the pit;


[GNSS|1CCE]and he rent his clothes.


[GNSS|1CCF]37,30 And he
[GNSS|1CD0]returned unto his brethren,
[GNSS|1CD1]and said: 'The child is
[GNSS|1CD2]not;


[GNSS|1CD3]and as for me, whither
[GNSS|1CD4]shall I go?' 37,31
[GNSS|1CD5]And they took Joseph's coat,
[GNSS|1CD6]and killed a he-goat,
[GNSS|1CD7]and dipped the coat in
[GNSS|1CD8]the blood;


[GNSS|1CD9]37,32 and they sent
[GNSS|1CDA]the coat of many colours,
[GNSS|1CDB]and they brought it to
[GNSS|1CDC]their father;


[GNSS|1CDD]and said: 'This
[GNSS|1CDE]have we found.


[GNSS|1CDF]Know now whether it is
[GNSS|1CE0]thy son's coat
[GNSS|1CE1]or not.' 37,33
[GNSS|1CE2]And he knew it,
[GNSS|1CE3]and said: 'It is my
[GNSS|1CE4]son's coat;


[GNSS|1CE5]an evil beast hath
[GNSS|1CE6]devoured him;


[GNSS|1CE7]Joseph is without doubt torn
[GNSS|1CE8]in pieces.' 37,34
[GNSS|1CE9]And Jacob rent his garments,
[GNSS|1CEA]and put sackcloth upon his
[GNSS|1CEB]loins, and mourned
[GNSS|1CEC]for his son many days.


[GNSS|1CED]37,35 And all his sons
[GNSS|1CEE]and all his daughters rose
[GNSS|1CEF]up to comfort him;


[GNSS|1CF0]but he refused to be
[GNSS|1CF1]comforted;


[GNSS|1CF2]and he said: 'Nay,
[GNSS|1CF3]but I will
[GNSS|1CF4]go down to
[GNSS|1CF5]the grave to my son
[GNSS|1CF6]mourning.' And his father wept
[GNSS|1CF7]for him.


[GNSS|1CF8]37,36 And the Midianites sold
[GNSS|1CF9]him into Egypt unto Potiphar,
[GNSS|1CFA]an officer of Pharaoh's,
[GNSS|1CFB]the captain of
[GNSS|1CFC]the guard.


[GNSS|1CFD]{P}  38,1
[GNSS|1CFE]And it came to pass
[GNSS|1CFF]at that time, that Judah
[GNSS|1D00]went down from his brethren,
[GNSS|1D01]and turned in to
[GNSS|1D02]a certain Adullamite,
[GNSS|1D03]whose name was Hirah.


[GNSS|1D04]38,2 And Judah saw there
[GNSS|1D05]a daughter of
[GNSS|1D06]a certain Canaanite
[GNSS|1D07]whose name was Shua;


[GNSS|1D08]and he took her,
[GNSS|1D09]and went in unto her.


[GNSS|1D0A]38,3 And she conceived,
[GNSS|1D0B]and bore a son;


[GNSS|1D0C]and he called his name
[GNSS|1D0D]Er. 38,4 And she
[GNSS|1D0E]conceived again, and bore
[GNSS|1D0F]a son;


[GNSS|1D10]and she called his name
[GNSS|1D11]Onan.


[GNSS|1D12]38,5 And she
[GNSS|1D13]yet again bore
[GNSS|1D14]a son, and
[GNSS|1D15]called his name Shelah;


[GNSS|1D16]and he was at Chezib,
[GNSS|1D17]when she bore him.


[GNSS|1D18]38,6 And Judah took
[GNSS|1D19]a wife for Er his
[GNSS|1D1A]first-born, and her name was
[GNSS|1D1B]Tamar.


[GNSS|1D1C]38,7 And Er, Judah's first-born,
[GNSS|1D1D]was wicked in
[GNSS|1D1E]the sight of
[GNSS|1D1F]the LORD;


[GNSS|1D20]and the LORD slew him.


[GNSS|1D21]38,8 And Judah
[GNSS|1D22]said unto Onan: 'Go in
[GNSS|1D23]unto thy brother's wife,
[GNSS|1D24]and perform the duty
[GNSS|1D25]of a husband's brother unto
[GNSS|1D26]her, and raise up seed
[GNSS|1D27]to thy brother.' 38,9
[GNSS|1D28]And Onan knew that
[GNSS|1D29]the seed would
[GNSS|1D2A]not be his;


[GNSS|1D2B]and it came to pass
[GNSS|1D2C]when he went in unto
[GNSS|1D2D]his brother's wife, that he
[GNSS|1D2E]spilled it on
[GNSS|1D2F]the ground, lest he should
[GNSS|1D30]give seed to his brother.


[GNSS|1D31]38,10 And the
[GNSS|1D32]thing which he did was
[GNSS|1D33]evil in the sight
[GNSS|1D34]of the LORD;


[GNSS|1D35]and He slew him also.


[GNSS|1D36]38,11 Then said Judah to
[GNSS|1D37]Tamar his daughter-in-law: 'Remain
[GNSS|1D38]a widow in thy father's
[GNSS|1D39]house, till Shelah my son
[GNSS|1D3A]be grown up';


[GNSS|1D3B]for he said: 'Lest he
[GNSS|1D3C]also die, like his brethren.'
[GNSS|1D3D]And Tamar went
[GNSS|1D3E]and dwelt in her father's
[GNSS|1D3F]house.


[GNSS|1D40]38,12 And in process
[GNSS|1D41]of time Shua's daughter,
[GNSS|1D42]the wife of Judah, died;


[GNSS|1D43]and Judah was comforted,
[GNSS|1D44]and went up unto his
[GNSS|1D45]sheep-shearers to Timnah, he
[GNSS|1D46]and his friend Hirah
[GNSS|1D47]the Adullamite.


[GNSS|1D48]38,13 And it was told
[GNSS|1D49]Tamar, saying: 'Behold, thy father-in-law
[GNSS|1D4A]goeth up to Timnah to
[GNSS|1D4B]shear his sheep.' 38,14
[GNSS|1D4C]And she put off from
[GNSS|1D4D]her the garments
[GNSS|1D4E]of her widowhood,
[GNSS|1D4F]and covered herself
[GNSS|1D50]with her veil,
[GNSS|1D51]and wrapped herself,
[GNSS|1D52]and sat in
[GNSS|1D53]the entrance of Enaim,
[GNSS|1D54]which is by
[GNSS|1D55]the way to Timnah;


[GNSS|1D56]for she saw that Shelah
[GNSS|1D57]was grown up,
[GNSS|1D58]and she was
[GNSS|1D59]not given unto him to
[GNSS|1D5A]wife.


[GNSS|1D5B]38,15 When Judah saw her,
[GNSS|1D5C]he thought her to be
[GNSS|1D5D]a harlot;


[GNSS|1D5E]for she had
[GNSS|1D5F]covered her face.


[GNSS|1D60]38,16 And he
[GNSS|1D61]turned unto her
[GNSS|1D62]by the way,
[GNSS|1D63]and said: 'Come, I pray
[GNSS|1D64]thee, let me come in
[GNSS|1D65]unto thee';


[GNSS|1D66]for he knew
[GNSS|1D67]not that she was his
[GNSS|1D68]daughter-in-law.


[GNSS|1D69]And she said: 'What wilt
[GNSS|1D6A]thou give me, that thou
[GNSS|1D6B]mayest come in unto me?'
[GNSS|1D6C]38,17 And he said: 'I
[GNSS|1D6D]will send thee
[GNSS|1D6E]a kid of
[GNSS|1D6F]the goats from
[GNSS|1D70]the flock.' And she said:
[GNSS|1D71]'Wilt thou give me
[GNSS|1D72]a pledge, till thou send
[GNSS|1D73]it?' 38,18 And he said:
[GNSS|1D74]'What pledge shall I give
[GNSS|1D75]thee?' And she said: 'Thy
[GNSS|1D76]signet and thy cord,
[GNSS|1D77]and thy staff that is
[GNSS|1D78]in thy hand.'
[GNSS|1D79]And he gave them to
[GNSS|1D7A]her, and came in unto
[GNSS|1D7B]her, and she
[GNSS|1D7C]conceived by him.


[GNSS|1D7D]38,19 And she arose,
[GNSS|1D7E]and went away,
[GNSS|1D7F]and put off her veil
[GNSS|1D80]from her, and put on
[GNSS|1D81]the garments of her widowhood.


[GNSS|1D82]38,20 And Judah sent
[GNSS|1D83]the kid of
[GNSS|1D84]the goats by
[GNSS|1D85]the hand of his friend
[GNSS|1D86]the Adullamite, to receive
[GNSS|1D87]the pledge from
[GNSS|1D88]the woman's hand;


[GNSS|1D89]but he found her not.


[GNSS|1D8A]38,21 Then he
[GNSS|1D8B]asked the men
[GNSS|1D8C]of her place, saying: 'Where
[GNSS|1D8D]is the harlot, that was
[GNSS|1D8E]at Enaim by
[GNSS|1D8F]the wayside?' And they said:
[GNSS|1D90]'There hath been
[GNSS|1D91]no harlot here.' 38,22
[GNSS|1D92]And he returned to Judah,
[GNSS|1D93]and said: 'I
[GNSS|1D94]have not found her;


[GNSS|1D95]and also the men
[GNSS|1D96]of the place said: There
[GNSS|1D97]hath been no harlot here.'
[GNSS|1D98]38,23 And Judah said: 'Let
[GNSS|1D99]her take it,
[GNSS|1D9A]lest we be put to
[GNSS|1D9B]shame;


[GNSS|1D9C]behold, I sent this kid,
[GNSS|1D9D]and thou hast
[GNSS|1D9E]not found her.' 38,24
[GNSS|1D9F]And it came to pass
[GNSS|1DA0]about three months after, that
[GNSS|1DA1]it was told Judah, saying:
[GNSS|1DA2]'Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath
[GNSS|1DA3]played the harlot;


[GNSS|1DA4]and moreover, behold, she is
[GNSS|1DA5]with child by harlotry.'
[GNSS|1DA6]And Judah said:
[GNSS|1DA7]'Bring her forth,
[GNSS|1DA8]and let her be burnt.'
[GNSS|1DA9]38,25 When she was brought
[GNSS|1DAA]forth, she sent to her
[GNSS|1DAB]father-in-law, saying: 'By
[GNSS|1DAC]the man, whose these are,
[GNSS|1DAD]am I with child';


[GNSS|1DAE]and she said: 'Discern, I
[GNSS|1DAF]pray thee, whose are these,
[GNSS|1DB0]the signet, and
[GNSS|1DB1]the cords, and
[GNSS|1DB2]the staff.' 38,26
[GNSS|1DB3]And Judah acknowledged them,
[GNSS|1DB4]and said: 'She is
[GNSS|1DB5]more righteous than I; forasmuch
[GNSS|1DB6]as I gave her
[GNSS|1DB7]not to Shelah my son.'
[GNSS|1DB8]And he knew her
[GNSS|1DB9]again no more.


[GNSS|1DBA]38,27 And it came to
[GNSS|1DBB]pass in the
[GNSS|1DBC]time of her travail, that,
[GNSS|1DBD]behold, twins were in her
[GNSS|1DBE]womb.


[GNSS|1DBF]38,28 And it came to
[GNSS|1DC0]pass, when she travailed, that
[GNSS|1DC1]one put out
[GNSS|1DC2]a hand;


[GNSS|1DC3]and the midwife took
[GNSS|1DC4]and bound upon his hand
[GNSS|1DC5]a scarlet thread, saying: 'This
[GNSS|1DC6]came out first.' 38,29
[GNSS|1DC7]And it came to pass,
[GNSS|1DC8]as he drew back his
[GNSS|1DC9]hand, that, behold his brother
[GNSS|1DCA]came out;


[GNSS|1DCB]and she said: 'Wherefore hast
[GNSS|1DCC]thou made a breach
[GNSS|1DCD]for thyself?' Therefore his name
[GNSS|1DCE]was called Perez.


[GNSS|1DCF]38,30 And afterward came out
[GNSS|1DD0]his brother, that
[GNSS|1DD1]had the scarlet thread upon
[GNSS|1DD2]his hand;


[GNSS|1DD3]and his name was
[GNSS|1DD4]called Zerah.


[GNSS|1DD5]{S} 39,1 And Joseph was
[GNSS|1DD6]brought down to Egypt;


[GNSS|1DD7]and Potiphar, an officer
[GNSS|1DD8]of Pharaoh's, the captain
[GNSS|1DD9]of the guard, an Egyptian,
[GNSS|1DDA]bought him of
[GNSS|1DDB]the hand of
[GNSS|1DDC]the Ishmaelites, that
[GNSS|1DDD]had brought him down thither.


[GNSS|1DDE]39,2 And the LORD was
[GNSS|1DDF]with Joseph, and he was
[GNSS|1DE0]a prosperous man;


[GNSS|1DE1]and he was in
[GNSS|1DE2]the house of his master
[GNSS|1DE3]the Egyptian.


[GNSS|1DE4]39,3 And his master saw
[GNSS|1DE5]that the LORD was
[GNSS|1DE6]with him, and that
[GNSS|1DE7]the LORD made all that
[GNSS|1DE8]he did to prosper in
[GNSS|1DE9]his hand.


[GNSS|1DEA]39,4 And Joseph found favour
[GNSS|1DEB]in his sight,
[GNSS|1DEC]and he ministered unto him.


[GNSS|1DED]And he appointed him overseer
[GNSS|1DEE]over his house,
[GNSS|1DEF]and all that he
[GNSS|1DF0]had he put into his
[GNSS|1DF1]hand.


[GNSS|1DF2]39,5 And it came to
[GNSS|1DF3]pass from the
[GNSS|1DF4]time that he
[GNSS|1DF5]appointed him overseer in his
[GNSS|1DF6]house, and over all that
[GNSS|1DF7]he had, that
[GNSS|1DF8]the LORD blessed
[GNSS|1DF9]the Egyptian's house
[GNSS|1DFA]for Joseph's sake;


[GNSS|1DFB]and the blessing
[GNSS|1DFC]of the LORD was upon
[GNSS|1DFD]all that he had, in
[GNSS|1DFE]the house and in
[GNSS|1DFF]the field.


[GNSS|1E00]39,6 And he left all
[GNSS|1E01]that he had in Joseph's
[GNSS|1E02]hand;


[GNSS|1E03]and, having him, he knew
[GNSS|1E04]not aught save
[GNSS|1E05]the bread which he did
[GNSS|1E06]eat.


[GNSS|1E07]And Joseph was
[GNSS|1E08]of beautiful form,
[GNSS|1E09]and fair to look upon.


[GNSS|1E0A]39,7 And it came to
[GNSS|1E0B]pass after these things, that
[GNSS|1E0C]his master's wife cast her
[GNSS|1E0D]eyes upon Joseph;


[GNSS|1E0E]and she said: 'Lie
[GNSS|1E0F]with me.' 39,8
[GNSS|1E10]But he refused,
[GNSS|1E11]and said unto his master's
[GNSS|1E12]wife: 'Behold, my master,
[GNSS|1E13]having me, knoweth
[GNSS|1E14]not what is in
[GNSS|1E15]the house, and he hath
[GNSS|1E16]put all that he hath
[GNSS|1E17]into my hand;


[GNSS|1E18]39,9 he is
[GNSS|1E19]not greater in this house
[GNSS|1E1A]than I; neither hath he
[GNSS|1E1B]kept back any
[GNSS|1E1C]thing from me
[GNSS|1E1D]but thee, because thou art
[GNSS|1E1E]his wife.


[GNSS|1E1F]How then can I
[GNSS|1E20]do this great wickedness,
[GNSS|1E21]and sin against God?' 39,10
[GNSS|1E22]And it came to pass,
[GNSS|1E23]as she spoke to Joseph
[GNSS|1E24]day by day, that he
[GNSS|1E25]hearkened not unto her, to
[GNSS|1E26]lie by her,
[GNSS|1E27]or to be
[GNSS|1E28]with her.


[GNSS|1E29]39,11 And it came to
[GNSS|1E2A]pass on a certain day,
[GNSS|1E2B]when he went into
[GNSS|1E2C]the house to
[GNSS|1E2D]do his work,
[GNSS|1E2E]and there was none
[GNSS|1E2F]of the men
[GNSS|1E30]of the house there within,
[GNSS|1E31]39,12 that she caught him
[GNSS|1E32]by his garment, saying: 'Lie
[GNSS|1E33]with me.' And he left
[GNSS|1E34]his garment in her hand,
[GNSS|1E35]and fled, and
[GNSS|1E36]got him out.


[GNSS|1E37]39,13 And it came to
[GNSS|1E38]pass, when she saw that
[GNSS|1E39]he had left his garment
[GNSS|1E3A]in her hand,
[GNSS|1E3B]and was fled forth, 39,14
[GNSS|1E3C]that she called unto
[GNSS|1E3D]the men of her house,
[GNSS|1E3E]and spoke unto them, saying:
[GNSS|1E3F]'See, he hath brought in
[GNSS|1E40]a Hebrew unto us to
[GNSS|1E41]mock us; he came in
[GNSS|1E42]unto me to lie
[GNSS|1E43]with me, and I
[GNSS|1E44]cried with a loud voice.


[GNSS|1E45]39,15 And it came to
[GNSS|1E46]pass, when he heard that
[GNSS|1E47]I lifted up my voice
[GNSS|1E48]and cried, that he left
[GNSS|1E49]his garment by me,
[GNSS|1E4A]and fled, and
[GNSS|1E4B]got him out.' 39,16
[GNSS|1E4C]And she laid up his
[GNSS|1E4D]garment by her,
[GNSS|1E4E]until his master came home.


[GNSS|1E4F]39,17 And she spoke unto
[GNSS|1E50]him according to these words,
[GNSS|1E51]saying: 'The Hebrew servant,
[GNSS|1E52]whom thou hast brought unto
[GNSS|1E53]us, came in unto me
[GNSS|1E54]to mock me. 39,18
[GNSS|1E55]And it came to pass,
[GNSS|1E56]as I lifted up my
[GNSS|1E57]voice and cried, that he
[GNSS|1E58]left his garment
[GNSS|1E59]by me, and fled out.'
[GNSS|1E5A]39,19 And it came to
[GNSS|1E5B]pass, when his master heard
[GNSS|1E5C]the words of his wife,
[GNSS|1E5D]which she spoke unto him,
[GNSS|1E5E]saying: 'After this manner did
[GNSS|1E5F]thy servant to me';


[GNSS|1E60]that his wrath was kindled.


[GNSS|1E61]39,20 And Joseph's master took
[GNSS|1E62]him, and put him into
[GNSS|1E63]the prison, the place
[GNSS|1E64]where the king's prisoners were
[GNSS|1E65]bound;


[GNSS|1E66]and he was there in
[GNSS|1E67]the prison.


[GNSS|1E68]39,21 But the LORD was
[GNSS|1E69]with Joseph, and
[GNSS|1E6A]showed kindness unto him,
[GNSS|1E6B]and gave him favour in
[GNSS|1E6C]the sight of
[GNSS|1E6D]the keeper of
[GNSS|1E6E]the prison.


[GNSS|1E6F]39,22 And the keeper
[GNSS|1E70]of the prison
[GNSS|1E71]committed to Joseph's hand all
[GNSS|1E72]the prisoners that were in
[GNSS|1E73]the prison;


[GNSS|1E74]and whatsoever they did there,
[GNSS|1E75]he was the doer
[GNSS|1E76]of it. 39,23
[GNSS|1E77]The keeper of
[GNSS|1E78]the prison looked
[GNSS|1E79]not to any
[GNSS|1E7A]thing that was under his
[GNSS|1E7B]hand, because the LORD was
[GNSS|1E7C]with him;


[GNSS|1E7D]and that which he did,
[GNSS|1E7E]the LORD made it to
[GNSS|1E7F]prosper.


[GNSS|1E80]{P}  40,1
[GNSS|1E81]And it came to pass
[GNSS|1E82]after these things, that
[GNSS|1E83]the butler of
[GNSS|1E84]the king of Egypt
[GNSS|1E85]and his baker
[GNSS|1E86]offended their lord
[GNSS|1E87]the king of Egypt.


[GNSS|1E88]40,2 And Pharaoh was wroth
[GNSS|1E89]against his two officers, against
[GNSS|1E8A]the chief of
[GNSS|1E8B]the butlers, and against
[GNSS|1E8C]the chief of
[GNSS|1E8D]the bakers.


[GNSS|1E8E]40,3 And he put them
[GNSS|1E8F]in ward in
[GNSS|1E90]the house of
[GNSS|1E91]the captain of
[GNSS|1E92]the guard, into
[GNSS|1E93]the prison, the place
[GNSS|1E94]where Joseph was bound.


[GNSS|1E95]40,4 And the captain
[GNSS|1E96]of the guard
[GNSS|1E97]charged Joseph to be
[GNSS|1E98]with them, and he
[GNSS|1E99]ministered unto them;


[GNSS|1E9A]and they continued
[GNSS|1E9B]a season in ward.


[GNSS|1E9C]40,5 And they
[GNSS|1E9D]dreamed a dream both
[GNSS|1E9E]of them, each man his
[GNSS|1E9F]dream, in one night, each
[GNSS|1EA0]man according to
[GNSS|1EA1]the interpretation of his dream,
[GNSS|1EA2]the butler and
[GNSS|1EA3]the baker of
[GNSS|1EA4]the king of Egypt,
[GNSS|1EA5]who were bound in
[GNSS|1EA6]the prison.


[GNSS|1EA7]40,6 And Joseph came in
[GNSS|1EA8]unto them in
[GNSS|1EA9]the morning, and saw them,
[GNSS|1EAA]and, behold, they were sad.


[GNSS|1EAB]40,7 And he
[GNSS|1EAC]asked Pharaoh's officers that were
[GNSS|1EAD]with him in
[GNSS|1EAE]the ward of his master's
[GNSS|1EAF]house, saying: 'Wherefore look ye
[GNSS|1EB0]so sad to-day?' 40,8
[GNSS|1EB1]And they said unto him:
[GNSS|1EB2]'We have dreamed
[GNSS|1EB3]a dream, and there is
[GNSS|1EB4]none that can interpret it.'
[GNSS|1EB5]And Joseph said unto them:
[GNSS|1EB6]'Do not interpretations belong to
[GNSS|1EB7]God? tell it me, I
[GNSS|1EB8]pray you.' 40,9
[GNSS|1EB9]And the chief butler told
[GNSS|1EBA]his dream to Joseph,
[GNSS|1EBB]and said to him: 'In
[GNSS|1EBC]my dream, behold,
[GNSS|1EBD]a vine was
[GNSS|1EBE]before me; 40,10
[GNSS|1EBF]and in the vine were
[GNSS|1EC0]three branches;


[GNSS|1EC1]and as it was budding,
[GNSS|1EC2]its blossoms shot forth,
[GNSS|1EC3]and the clusters thereof brought
[GNSS|1EC4]forth ripe grapes, 40,11
[GNSS|1EC5]and Pharaoh's cup was in
[GNSS|1EC6]my hand;


[GNSS|1EC7]and I took
[GNSS|1EC8]the grapes, and
[GNSS|1EC9]pressed them into Pharaoh's cup,
[GNSS|1ECA]and I gave
[GNSS|1ECB]the cup into Pharaoh's hand.'
[GNSS|1ECC]40,12 And Joseph
[GNSS|1ECD]said unto him: 'This is
[GNSS|1ECE]the interpretation of it:
[GNSS|1ECF]the three branches are three
[GNSS|1ED0]days;


[GNSS|1ED1]40,13 within yet three days
[GNSS|1ED2]shall Pharaoh lift up thy
[GNSS|1ED3]head, and restore thee unto
[GNSS|1ED4]thine office;


[GNSS|1ED5]and thou shalt give Pharaoh's
[GNSS|1ED6]cup into his hand,
[GNSS|1ED7]after the former manner
[GNSS|1ED8]when thou wast his butler.


[GNSS|1ED9]40,14 But have me in
[GNSS|1EDA]thy remembrance when it shall
[GNSS|1EDB]be well with thee,
[GNSS|1EDC]and show kindness, I pray
[GNSS|1EDD]thee, unto me,
[GNSS|1EDE]and make mention
[GNSS|1EDF]of me unto Pharaoh,
[GNSS|1EE0]and bring me out
[GNSS|1EE1]of this house.


[GNSS|1EE2]40,15 For indeed I was
[GNSS|1EE3]stolen away out
[GNSS|1EE4]of the land
[GNSS|1EE5]of the Hebrews;


[GNSS|1EE6]and here also
[GNSS|1EE7]have I done
[GNSS|1EE8]nothing that they should put
[GNSS|1EE9]me into the dungeon.' 40,16
[GNSS|1EEA]When the chief baker saw
[GNSS|1EEB]that the interpretation was good,
[GNSS|1EEC]he said unto Joseph: 'I
[GNSS|1EED]also saw in my dream,
[GNSS|1EEE]and, behold, three baskets
[GNSS|1EEF]of white bread were on
[GNSS|1EF0]my head;


[GNSS|1EF1]40,17 and in
[GNSS|1EF2]the uppermost basket there was
[GNSS|1EF3]of all manner
[GNSS|1EF4]of baked food
[GNSS|1EF5]for Pharaoh;


[GNSS|1EF6]and the birds did eat
[GNSS|1EF7]them out of
[GNSS|1EF8]the basket upon my head.'
[GNSS|1EF9]40,18 And Joseph
[GNSS|1EFA]answered and said: 'This is
[GNSS|1EFB]the interpretation thereof:
[GNSS|1EFC]the three baskets are three
[GNSS|1EFD]days;


[GNSS|1EFE]40,19 within yet three days
[GNSS|1EFF]shall Pharaoh lift up thy
[GNSS|1F00]head from off thee,
[GNSS|1F01]and shall hang thee on
[GNSS|1F02]a tree;


[GNSS|1F03]and the birds shall eat
[GNSS|1F04]thy flesh from off thee.'
[GNSS|1F05]40,20 And it came to
[GNSS|1F06]pass the third day,
[GNSS|1F07]which was Pharaoh's birthday, that
[GNSS|1F08]he made a feast unto
[GNSS|1F09]all his servants;


[GNSS|1F0A]and he lifted up
[GNSS|1F0B]the head of
[GNSS|1F0C]the chief butler
[GNSS|1F0D]and the head
[GNSS|1F0E]of the chief baker among
[GNSS|1F0F]his servants.


[GNSS|1F10]40,21 And he
[GNSS|1F11]restored the chief butler back
[GNSS|1F12]unto his butlership;


[GNSS|1F13]and he gave
[GNSS|1F14]the cup into Pharaoh's hand.


[GNSS|1F15]40,22 But he
[GNSS|1F16]hanged the chief baker,
[GNSS|1F17]as Joseph had
[GNSS|1F18]interpreted to them.


[GNSS|1F19]40,23 Yet did
[GNSS|1F1A]not the chief butler remember
[GNSS|1F1B]Joseph, but forgot him.


[GNSS|1F1C]{P}  41,1
[GNSS|1F1D]And it came to pass
[GNSS|1F1E]at the end
[GNSS|1F1F]of two full years, that
[GNSS|1F20]Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he
[GNSS|1F21]stood by the river.


[GNSS|1F22]41,2 And, behold, there came
[GNSS|1F23]up out of
[GNSS|1F24]the river seven kine,
[GNSS|1F25]well-favoured and fat-fleshed;


[GNSS|1F26]and they fed in
[GNSS|1F27]the reed-grass.


[GNSS|1F28]41,3 And, behold, seven other
[GNSS|1F29]kine came up
[GNSS|1F2A]after them out
[GNSS|1F2B]of the river, ill
[GNSS|1F2C]favoured and lean-fleshed;


[GNSS|1F2D]and stood by
[GNSS|1F2E]the other kine upon
[GNSS|1F2F]the brink of
[GNSS|1F30]the river.


[GNSS|1F31]41,4 And the
[GNSS|1F32]ill-favoured and lean-fleshed kine did
[GNSS|1F33]eat up the seven
[GNSS|1F34]well-favoured and fat kine.


[GNSS|1F35]So Pharaoh awoke.


[GNSS|1F36]41,5 And he slept
[GNSS|1F37]and dreamed a
[GNSS|1F38]second time: and, behold, seven
[GNSS|1F39]ears of corn came up
[GNSS|1F3A]upon one stalk, rank
[GNSS|1F3B]and good.


[GNSS|1F3C]41,6 And, behold, seven ears,
[GNSS|1F3D]thin and blasted
[GNSS|1F3E]with the east wind, sprung
[GNSS|1F3F]up after them.


[GNSS|1F40]41,7 And the thin ears
[GNSS|1F41]swallowed up the seven rank
[GNSS|1F42]and full ears.


[GNSS|1F43]And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold,
[GNSS|1F44]it was a dream.


[GNSS|1F45]41,8 And it came to
[GNSS|1F46]pass in the
[GNSS|1F47]morning that his spirit was
[GNSS|1F48]troubled;


[GNSS|1F49]and he sent
[GNSS|1F4A]and called for all
[GNSS|1F4B]the magicians of Egypt,
[GNSS|1F4C]and all the wise men
[GNSS|1F4D]thereof;


[GNSS|1F4E]and Pharaoh told them his
[GNSS|1F4F]dream;


[GNSS|1F50]but there was none that
[GNSS|1F51]could interpret them unto Pharaoh.


[GNSS|1F52]41,9 Then spoke
[GNSS|1F53]the chief butler unto Pharaoh,
[GNSS|1F54]saying: 'I make mention
[GNSS|1F55]of my faults this day:
[GNSS|1F56]41,10 Pharaoh was wroth
[GNSS|1F57]with his servants,
[GNSS|1F58]and put me in
[GNSS|1F59]the ward of
[GNSS|1F5A]the house of
[GNSS|1F5B]the captain of
[GNSS|1F5C]the guard, me
[GNSS|1F5D]and the chief baker.


[GNSS|1F5E]41,11 And we
[GNSS|1F5F]dreamed a dream in one
[GNSS|1F60]night, I and he; we
[GNSS|1F61]dreamed each man
[GNSS|1F62]according to the interpretation
[GNSS|1F63]of his dream.


[GNSS|1F64]41,12 And there was
[GNSS|1F65]with us there
[GNSS|1F66]a young man,
[GNSS|1F67]a Hebrew, servant to
[GNSS|1F68]the captain of
[GNSS|1F69]the guard;


[GNSS|1F6A]and we told him,
[GNSS|1F6B]and he interpreted to us
[GNSS|1F6C]our dreams;


[GNSS|1F6D]to each man
[GNSS|1F6E]according to his dream he
[GNSS|1F6F]did interpret.


[GNSS|1F70]41,13 And it came to
[GNSS|1F71]pass, as he
[GNSS|1F72]interpreted to us,
[GNSS|1F73]so it was: I was
[GNSS|1F74]restored unto mine office,
[GNSS|1F75]and he was hanged.' 41,14
[GNSS|1F76]Then Pharaoh sent
[GNSS|1F77]and called Joseph,
[GNSS|1F78]and they brought him hastily
[GNSS|1F79]out of the dungeon.


[GNSS|1F7A]And he shaved himself,
[GNSS|1F7B]and changed his raiment,
[GNSS|1F7C]and came in unto Pharaoh.


[GNSS|1F7D]41,15 And Pharaoh
[GNSS|1F7E]said unto Joseph: 'I
[GNSS|1F7F]have dreamed a dream,
[GNSS|1F80]and there is none that
[GNSS|1F81]can interpret it;
[GNSS|1F82]and I have heard
[GNSS|1F83]say of thee, that
[GNSS|1F84]when thou hearest
[GNSS|1F85]a dream thou canst interpret
[GNSS|1F86]it.' 41,16 And Joseph
[GNSS|1F87]answered Pharaoh, saying: 'It is
[GNSS|1F88]not in me; God
[GNSS|1F89]will give Pharaoh an answer
[GNSS|1F8A]of peace.' 41,17
[GNSS|1F8B]And Pharaoh spoke unto Joseph:
[GNSS|1F8C]'In my dream, behold, I
[GNSS|1F8D]stood upon the brink
[GNSS|1F8E]of the river.


[GNSS|1F8F]41,18 And, behold, there came
[GNSS|1F90]up out of
[GNSS|1F91]the river seven kine,
[GNSS|1F92]fat-fleshed and well-favoured;


[GNSS|1F93]and they fed in
[GNSS|1F94]the reed-grass.


[GNSS|1F95]41,19 And, behold, seven other
[GNSS|1F96]kine came up
[GNSS|1F97]after them, poor
[GNSS|1F98]and very ill-favoured
[GNSS|1F99]and lean-fleshed, such
[GNSS|1F9A]as I never saw in
[GNSS|1F9B]all the land
[GNSS|1F9C]of Egypt for badness.


[GNSS|1F9D]41,20 And the lean
[GNSS|1F9E]and ill-favoured kine did eat
[GNSS|1F9F]up the first seven fat
[GNSS|1FA0]kine.


[GNSS|1FA1]41,21 And when they
[GNSS|1FA2]had eaten them up, it
[GNSS|1FA3]could not be known that
[GNSS|1FA4]they had eaten them;


[GNSS|1FA5]but they were
[GNSS|1FA6]still ill-favoured as at
[GNSS|1FA7]the beginning.


[GNSS|1FA8]So I awoke.


[GNSS|1FA9]41,22 And I saw in
[GNSS|1FAA]my dream, and, behold, seven
[GNSS|1FAB]ears came up upon one
[GNSS|1FAC]stalk, full and good.


[GNSS|1FAD]41,23 And, behold, seven ears,
[GNSS|1FAE]withered, thin, and
[GNSS|1FAF]blasted with the east wind,
[GNSS|1FB0]sprung up after them.


[GNSS|1FB1]41,24 And the thin ears
[GNSS|1FB2]swallowed up the seven good
[GNSS|1FB3]ears.


[GNSS|1FB4]And I told it unto
[GNSS|1FB5]the magicians;


[GNSS|1FB6]but there was none that
[GNSS|1FB7]could declare it to me.'
[GNSS|1FB8]41,25 And Joseph
[GNSS|1FB9]said unto Pharaoh: 'The dream
[GNSS|1FBA]of Pharaoh is one;


[GNSS|1FBB]what God is about to
[GNSS|1FBC]do He hath
[GNSS|1FBD]declared unto Pharaoh.


[GNSS|1FBE]41,26 The seven good kine
[GNSS|1FBF]are seven years;


[GNSS|1FC0]and the seven good ears
[GNSS|1FC1]are seven years:
[GNSS|1FC2]the dream is one.


[GNSS|1FC3]41,27 And the seven lean
[GNSS|1FC4]and ill-favoured kine that came
[GNSS|1FC5]up after them are seven
[GNSS|1FC6]years, and also
[GNSS|1FC7]the seven empty ears
[GNSS|1FC8]blasted with the east wind;


[GNSS|1FC9]they shall be seven years
[GNSS|1FCA]of famine.


[GNSS|1FCB]41,28 That is
[GNSS|1FCC]the thing which I spoke
[GNSS|1FCD]unto Pharaoh: what God is
[GNSS|1FCE]about to do He hath
[GNSS|1FCF]shown unto Pharaoh.


[GNSS|1FD0]41,29 Behold, there come seven
[GNSS|1FD1]years of great plenty
[GNSS|1FD2]throughout all the land
[GNSS|1FD3]of Egypt.


[GNSS|1FD4]41,30 And there shall arise
[GNSS|1FD5]after them seven years
[GNSS|1FD6]of famine;


[GNSS|1FD7]and all the plenty shall
[GNSS|1FD8]be forgotten in
[GNSS|1FD9]the land of Egypt;


[GNSS|1FDA]and the famine shall consume
[GNSS|1FDB]the land;


[GNSS|1FDC]41,31 and the plenty shall
[GNSS|1FDD]not be known in
[GNSS|1FDE]the land by reason
[GNSS|1FDF]of that famine
[GNSS|1FE0]which followeth;


[GNSS|1FE1]for it shall be very
[GNSS|1FE2]grievous.


[GNSS|1FE3]41,32 And for that
[GNSS|1FE4]the dream was
[GNSS|1FE5]doubled unto Pharaoh twice, it
[GNSS|1FE6]is because the
[GNSS|1FE7]thing is established
[GNSS|1FE8]by God, and God
[GNSS|1FE9]will shortly bring it to
[GNSS|1FEA]pass.


[GNSS|1FEB]41,33 Now therefore let Pharaoh
[GNSS|1FEC]look out a man discreet
[GNSS|1FED]and wise, and set him
[GNSS|1FEE]over the land
[GNSS|1FEF]of Egypt.


[GNSS|1FF0]41,34 Let Pharaoh
[GNSS|1FF1]do this, and let him
[GNSS|1FF2]appoint overseers over
[GNSS|1FF3]the land, and take up
[GNSS|1FF4]the fifth part
[GNSS|1FF5]of the land
[GNSS|1FF6]of Egypt in
[GNSS|1FF7]the seven years
[GNSS|1FF8]of plenty.


[GNSS|1FF9]41,35 And let them gather
[GNSS|1FFA]all the food
[GNSS|1FFB]of these good years that
[GNSS|1FFC]come, and lay up corn
[GNSS|1FFD]under the hand
[GNSS|1FFE]of Pharaoh for food in
[GNSS|1FFF]the cities, and let them
[GNSS|2000]keep it. 41,36
[GNSS|2001]And the food shall be
[GNSS|2002]for a store to
[GNSS|2003]the land against
[GNSS|2004]the seven years
[GNSS|2005]of famine, which shall be
[GNSS|2006]in the land
[GNSS|2007]of Egypt;


[GNSS|2008]that the land perish
[GNSS|2009]not through the famine.' 41,37
[GNSS|200A]And the thing was good
[GNSS|200B]in the eyes
[GNSS|200C]of Pharaoh, and in
[GNSS|200D]the eyes of all his
[GNSS|200E]servants.


[GNSS|200F]41,38 And Pharaoh
[GNSS|2010]said unto his servants: 'Can
[GNSS|2011]we find such
[GNSS|2012]a one as this,
[GNSS|2013]a man in
[GNSS|2014]whom the spirit
[GNSS|2015]of God is?' 41,39
[GNSS|2016]And Pharaoh said unto Joseph:
[GNSS|2017]'Forasmuch as God hath shown
[GNSS|2018]thee all this, there is
[GNSS|2019]none so discreet
[GNSS|201A]and wise as thou.


[GNSS|201B]41,40 Thou shalt be
[GNSS|201C]over my house,
[GNSS|201D]and according unto thy word
[GNSS|201E]shall all my people be
[GNSS|201F]ruled;


[GNSS|2020]only in the throne
[GNSS|2021]will I be greater
[GNSS|2022]than thou.' 41,41
[GNSS|2023]And Pharaoh said unto Joseph:
[GNSS|2024]'See, I have set thee
[GNSS|2025]over all the land
[GNSS|2026]of Egypt.' 41,42
[GNSS|2027]And Pharaoh took off his
[GNSS|2028]signet ring from his hand,
[GNSS|2029]and put it upon Joseph's
[GNSS|202A]hand, and arrayed him in
[GNSS|202B]vestures of fine linen,
[GNSS|202C]and put a gold chain
[GNSS|202D]about his neck.


[GNSS|202E]41,43 And he
[GNSS|202F]made him to ride in
[GNSS|2030]the second chariot
[GNSS|2031]which he had;


[GNSS|2032]and they cried
[GNSS|2033]before him: 'Abrech';


[GNSS|2034]and he set him
[GNSS|2035]over all the land
[GNSS|2036]of Egypt.


[GNSS|2037]41,44 And Pharaoh
[GNSS|2038]said unto Joseph: 'I am
[GNSS|2039]Pharaoh, and without thee shall
[GNSS|203A]no man lift up his
[GNSS|203B]hand or his foot in
[GNSS|203C]all the land
[GNSS|203D]of Egypt.' 41,45
[GNSS|203E]And Pharaoh called Joseph's name
[GNSS|203F]Zaphenath-paneah;


[GNSS|2040]and he gave him to
[GNSS|2041]wife Asenath the daughter
[GNSS|2042]of Poti-phera priest
[GNSS|2043]of On. And Joseph
[GNSS|2044]went out over
[GNSS|2045]the land of Egypt.- 41,46
[GNSS|2046]And Joseph was thirty years
[GNSS|2047]old when he stood
[GNSS|2048]before Pharaoh king
[GNSS|2049]of Egypt.-And Joseph
[GNSS|204A]went out from
[GNSS|204B]the presence of Pharaoh,
[GNSS|204C]and went throughout all
[GNSS|204D]the land of Egypt.


[GNSS|204E]41,47 And in
[GNSS|204F]the seven years
[GNSS|2050]of plenty the earth brought
[GNSS|2051]forth in heaps.


[GNSS|2052]41,48 And he
[GNSS|2053]gathered up all
[GNSS|2054]the food of
[GNSS|2055]the seven years
[GNSS|2056]which were in
[GNSS|2057]the land of Egypt,
[GNSS|2058]and laid up
[GNSS|2059]the food in
[GNSS|205A]the cities;


[GNSS|205B]the food of
[GNSS|205C]the field, which was round
[GNSS|205D]about every city, laid he
[GNSS|205E]up in the same.


[GNSS|205F]41,49 And Joseph laid up
[GNSS|2060]corn as the sand
[GNSS|2061]of the sea, very much,
[GNSS|2062]until they left off numbering;


[GNSS|2063]for it was
[GNSS|2064]without number.


[GNSS|2065]41,50 And unto Joseph were
[GNSS|2066]born two sons
[GNSS|2067]before the year
[GNSS|2068]of famine came,
[GNSS|2069]whom Asenath the daughter
[GNSS|206A]of Poti-phera priest
[GNSS|206B]of On bore unto him.


[GNSS|206C]41,51 And Joseph
[GNSS|206D]called the name
[GNSS|206E]of the first-born Manasseh: 'for
[GNSS|206F]God hath made me forget
[GNSS|2070]all my toil,
[GNSS|2071]and all my father's house.'
[GNSS|2072]41,52 And the name
[GNSS|2073]of the second
[GNSS|2074]called he Ephraim: 'for God
[GNSS|2075]hath made me fruitful in
[GNSS|2076]the land of my affliction.'
[GNSS|2077]41,53 And the seven years
[GNSS|2078]of plenty, that was in
[GNSS|2079]the land of Egypt, came
[GNSS|207A]to an end.


[GNSS|207B]41,54 And the seven years
[GNSS|207C]of famine began to come,
[GNSS|207D]according as Joseph
[GNSS|207E]had said;


[GNSS|207F]and there was famine in
[GNSS|2080]all lands;


[GNSS|2081]but in all
[GNSS|2082]the land of Egypt there
[GNSS|2083]was bread.


[GNSS|2084]41,55 And when all
[GNSS|2085]the land of Egypt was
[GNSS|2086]famished, the people
[GNSS|2087]cried to Pharaoh
[GNSS|2088]for bread;


[GNSS|2089]and Pharaoh said unto all
[GNSS|208A]the Egyptians: 'Go unto Joseph;


[GNSS|208B]what he saith to you,
[GNSS|208C]do.' 41,56 And
[GNSS|208D]the famine was
[GNSS|208E]over all the face
[GNSS|208F]of the earth;


[GNSS|2090]and Joseph opened all
[GNSS|2091]the storehouses, and sold unto
[GNSS|2092]the Egyptians;


[GNSS|2093]and the famine was sore
[GNSS|2094]in the land
[GNSS|2095]of Egypt.


[GNSS|2096]41,57 And all countries came
[GNSS|2097]into Egypt to Joseph to
[GNSS|2098]buy corn;


[GNSS|2099]because the famine was sore
[GNSS|209A]in all the earth.


[GNSS|209B]42,1 Now Jacob saw that
[GNSS|209C]there was corn in Egypt,
[GNSS|209D]and Jacob said unto his
[GNSS|209E]sons: 'Why do ye look
[GNSS|209F]one upon another?' 42,2
[GNSS|20A0]And he said: 'Behold, I
[GNSS|20A1]have heard that there is
[GNSS|20A2]corn in Egypt.


[GNSS|20A3]Get you down thither,
[GNSS|20A4]and buy for us from
[GNSS|20A5]thence;


[GNSS|20A6]that we may live,
[GNSS|20A7]and not die.' 42,3
[GNSS|20A8]And Joseph's ten brethren
[GNSS|20A9]went down to buy corn
[GNSS|20AA]from Egypt.


[GNSS|20AB]42,4 But Benjamin, Joseph's brother,
[GNSS|20AC]Jacob sent not
[GNSS|20AD]with his brethren;


[GNSS|20AE]for he said: 'Lest peradventure
[GNSS|20AF]harm befall him.' 42,5
[GNSS|20B0]And the sons
[GNSS|20B1]of Israel came to buy
[GNSS|20B2]among those that came;


[GNSS|20B3]for the famine was in
[GNSS|20B4]the land of Canaan.


[GNSS|20B5]42,6 And Joseph was
[GNSS|20B6]the governor over
[GNSS|20B7]the land;


[GNSS|20B8]he it was that sold
[GNSS|20B9]to all the people
[GNSS|20BA]of the land.


[GNSS|20BB]And Joseph's brethren came,
[GNSS|20BC]and bowed down to him
[GNSS|20BD]with their faces to
[GNSS|20BE]the earth.


[GNSS|20BF]42,7 And Joseph saw his
[GNSS|20C0]brethren, and he knew them,
[GNSS|20C1]but made himself strange unto
[GNSS|20C2]them, and spoke roughly
[GNSS|20C3]with them;


[GNSS|20C4]and he said unto them:
[GNSS|20C5]'Whence come ye?'
[GNSS|20C6]And they said: 'From
[GNSS|20C7]the land of Canaan to
[GNSS|20C8]buy food.' 42,8
[GNSS|20C9]And Joseph knew his brethren,
[GNSS|20CA]but they knew him not.


[GNSS|20CB]42,9 And Joseph
[GNSS|20CC]remembered the dreams
[GNSS|20CD]which he dreamed
[GNSS|20CE]of them, and
[GNSS|20CF]said unto them: 'Ye are
[GNSS|20D0]spies;


[GNSS|20D1]to see the nakedness
[GNSS|20D2]of the land ye are
[GNSS|20D3]come.' 42,10 And they
[GNSS|20D4]said unto him: 'Nay, my
[GNSS|20D5]lord, but to buy food
[GNSS|20D6]are thy servants come.


[GNSS|20D7]42,11 We are all one
[GNSS|20D8]man's sons;


[GNSS|20D9]we are upright men, thy
[GNSS|20DA]servants are no spies.' 42,12
[GNSS|20DB]And he said unto them:
[GNSS|20DC]'Nay, but to see
[GNSS|20DD]the nakedness of
[GNSS|20DE]the land ye are come.'
[GNSS|20DF]42,13 And they said: 'We
[GNSS|20E0]thy servants are twelve brethren,
[GNSS|20E1]the sons of one man
[GNSS|20E2]in the land
[GNSS|20E3]of Canaan;


[GNSS|20E4]and, behold, the youngest is
[GNSS|20E5]this day with our father,
[GNSS|20E6]and one is not.' 42,14
[GNSS|20E7]And Joseph said unto them:
[GNSS|20E8]'That is it that I
[GNSS|20E9]spoke unto you, saying: Ye
[GNSS|20EA]are spies.


[GNSS|20EB]42,15 Hereby ye shall be
[GNSS|20EC]proved, as Pharaoh liveth, ye
[GNSS|20ED]shall not go forth hence,
[GNSS|20EE]except your youngest brother come
[GNSS|20EF]hither.


[GNSS|20F0]42,16 Send one
[GNSS|20F1]of you, and let him
[GNSS|20F2]fetch your brother,
[GNSS|20F3]and ye shall be bound,
[GNSS|20F4]that your words may be
[GNSS|20F5]proved, whether there be truth
[GNSS|20F6]in you;


[GNSS|20F7]or else, as Pharaoh liveth,
[GNSS|20F8]surely ye are spies.' 42,17
[GNSS|20F9]And he put them all
[GNSS|20FA]together into ward three days.


[GNSS|20FB]42,18 And Joseph
[GNSS|20FC]said unto them
[GNSS|20FD]the third day.


[GNSS|20FE]'This do, and live;


[GNSS|20FF]for I fear God: 42,19
[GNSS|2100]if ye be upright men,
[GNSS|2101]let one of your brethren
[GNSS|2102]be bound in your prison-house;


[GNSS|2103]but go ye, carry corn
[GNSS|2104]for the famine
[GNSS|2105]of your houses;


[GNSS|2106]42,20 and bring your youngest
[GNSS|2107]brother unto me;
[GNSS|2108]so shall your words be
[GNSS|2109]verified, and ye shall
[GNSS|210A]not die.' And they did
[GNSS|210B]so. 42,21 And they
[GNSS|210C]said one to another: 'We
[GNSS|210D]are verily guilty
[GNSS|210E]concerning our brother, in that
[GNSS|210F]we saw the distress
[GNSS|2110]of his soul,
[GNSS|2111]when he besought us,
[GNSS|2112]and we would
[GNSS|2113]not hear;


[GNSS|2114]therefore is this distress come
[GNSS|2115]upon us.' 42,22
[GNSS|2116]And Reuben answered them, saying:
[GNSS|2117]'Spoke I not unto you,
[GNSS|2118]saying: Do not sin against
[GNSS|2119]the child;


[GNSS|211A]and ye would
[GNSS|211B]not hear? therefore also, behold,
[GNSS|211C]his blood is required.' 42,23
[GNSS|211D]And they knew
[GNSS|211E]not that Joseph understood them;


[GNSS|211F]for the interpreter was between
[GNSS|2120]them.


[GNSS|2121]42,24 And he
[GNSS|2122]turned himself about from them,
[GNSS|2123]and wept;


[GNSS|2124]and he returned to them,
[GNSS|2125]and spoke to them,
[GNSS|2126]and took Simeon from among
[GNSS|2127]them, and bound him
[GNSS|2128]before their eyes.


[GNSS|2129]42,25 Then Joseph
[GNSS|212A]commanded to fill their vessels
[GNSS|212B]with corn, and to restore
[GNSS|212C]every man's money into his
[GNSS|212D]sack, and to give them
[GNSS|212E]provision for the way;


[GNSS|212F]and thus was it done
[GNSS|2130]unto them.


[GNSS|2131]42,26 And they
[GNSS|2132]laded their asses
[GNSS|2133]with their corn,
[GNSS|2134]and departed thence.


[GNSS|2135]42,27 And as one
[GNSS|2136]of them opened his sack
[GNSS|2137]to give his ass provender
[GNSS|2138]in the lodging-place, he
[GNSS|2139]espied his money;


[GNSS|213A]and, behold, it was in
[GNSS|213B]the mouth of his sack.


[GNSS|213C]42,28 And he
[GNSS|213D]said unto his brethren: 'My
[GNSS|213E]money is restored;


[GNSS|213F]and, lo, it is
[GNSS|2140]even in my sack.'
[GNSS|2141]And their heart
[GNSS|2142]failed them, and they
[GNSS|2143]turned trembling one to another,
[GNSS|2144]saying: 'What is this that
[GNSS|2145]God hath done unto us?'
[GNSS|2146]42,29 And they came unto
[GNSS|2147]Jacob their father unto
[GNSS|2148]the land of Canaan,
[GNSS|2149]and told him all that
[GNSS|214A]had befallen them, saying: 42,30
[GNSS|214B]'The man, the lord
[GNSS|214C]of the land, spoke roughly
[GNSS|214D]with us, and took us
[GNSS|214E]for spies of
[GNSS|214F]the country.


[GNSS|2150]42,31 And we
[GNSS|2151]said unto him: We are
[GNSS|2152]upright men;


[GNSS|2153]we are no spies.


[GNSS|2154]42,32 We are twelve brethren,
[GNSS|2155]sons of our father;


[GNSS|2156]one is not,
[GNSS|2157]and the youngest is this
[GNSS|2158]day with our father in
[GNSS|2159]the land of Canaan.


[GNSS|215A]42,33 And the man,
[GNSS|215B]the lord of
[GNSS|215C]the land, said unto us:
[GNSS|215D]Hereby shall I know that
[GNSS|215E]ye are upright men: leave
[GNSS|215F]one of your brethren
[GNSS|2160]with me, and take corn
[GNSS|2161]for the famine
[GNSS|2162]of your houses,
[GNSS|2163]and go your way.


[GNSS|2164]42,34 And bring your youngest
[GNSS|2165]brother unto me;
[GNSS|2166]then shall I know that
[GNSS|2167]ye are no spies,
[GNSS|2168]but that ye are upright
[GNSS|2169]men;


[GNSS|216A]so will I deliver you
[GNSS|216B]your brother, and ye shall
[GNSS|216C]traffic in the land.' 42,35
[GNSS|216D]And it came to pass
[GNSS|216E]as they emptied their sacks,
[GNSS|216F]that, behold, every man's bundle
[GNSS|2170]of money was in his
[GNSS|2171]sack;


[GNSS|2172]and when they
[GNSS|2173]and their father saw their
[GNSS|2174]bundles of money, they were
[GNSS|2175]afraid.


[GNSS|2176]42,36 And Jacob their father
[GNSS|2177]said unto them: 'Me
[GNSS|2178]have ye bereaved
[GNSS|2179]of my children: Joseph is
[GNSS|217A]not, and Simeon is not,
[GNSS|217B]and ye will take Benjamin
[GNSS|217C]away;


[GNSS|217D]upon me are all these
[GNSS|217E]things come.' 42,37
[GNSS|217F]And Reuben spoke unto his
[GNSS|2180]father, saying: 'Thou shalt slay
[GNSS|2181]my two sons,
[GNSS|2182]if I bring him
[GNSS|2183]not to thee;


[GNSS|2184]deliver him into my hand,
[GNSS|2185]and I will
[GNSS|2186]bring him back to thee.'
[GNSS|2187]42,38 And he said: 'My
[GNSS|2188]son shall not
[GNSS|2189]go down with you;


[GNSS|218A]for his brother is dead,
[GNSS|218B]and he only is left;


[GNSS|218C]if harm befall him
[GNSS|218D]by the way in
[GNSS|218E]which ye go,
[GNSS|218F]then will ye
[GNSS|2190]bring down my gray hairs
[GNSS|2191]with sorrow to
[GNSS|2192]the grave.


[GNSS|2193]43,1 And the famine was
[GNSS|2194]sore in the land.


[GNSS|2195]43,2 And it came to
[GNSS|2196]pass, when they
[GNSS|2197]had eaten up
[GNSS|2198]the corn which they
[GNSS|2199]had brought out
[GNSS|219A]of Egypt, that their father
[GNSS|219B]said unto them: 'Go again,
[GNSS|219C]buy us a little food.'
[GNSS|219D]43,3 And Judah spoke unto
[GNSS|219E]him, saying: 'The man did
[GNSS|219F]earnestly forewarn us, saying: Ye
[GNSS|21A0]shall not see my face,
[GNSS|21A1]except your brother be
[GNSS|21A2]with you.


[GNSS|21A3]43,4 If thou wilt send
[GNSS|21A4]our brother with us, we
[GNSS|21A5]will go down
[GNSS|21A6]and buy thee food;


[GNSS|21A7]43,5 but if thou wilt
[GNSS|21A8]not send him, we
[GNSS|21A9]will not go down,
[GNSS|21AA]for the man
[GNSS|21AB]said unto us: Ye shall
[GNSS|21AC]not see my face, except
[GNSS|21AD]your brother be
[GNSS|21AE]with you.' 43,6
[GNSS|21AF]And Israel said: 'Wherefore dealt
[GNSS|21B0]ye so ill
[GNSS|21B1]with me, as to tell
[GNSS|21B2]the man whether ye
[GNSS|21B3]had yet a brother?' 43,7
[GNSS|21B4]And they said: 'The man
[GNSS|21B5]asked straitly concerning ourselves,
[GNSS|21B6]and concerning our kindred, saying:
[GNSS|21B7]Is your father
[GNSS|21B8]yet alive? have ye another
[GNSS|21B9]brother? and we told him
[GNSS|21BA]according to the tenor
[GNSS|21BB]of these words;


[GNSS|21BC]could we in any wise
[GNSS|21BD]know that he
[GNSS|21BE]would say: Bring your brother
[GNSS|21BF]down?' 43,8 And Judah
[GNSS|21C0]said unto Israel his father:
[GNSS|21C1]'Send the lad
[GNSS|21C2]with me, and we
[GNSS|21C3]will arise and go, that
[GNSS|21C4]we may live,
[GNSS|21C5]and not die, both we,
[GNSS|21C6]and thou, and
[GNSS|21C7]also our little ones.


[GNSS|21C8]43,9 I will be surety
[GNSS|21C9]for him;


[GNSS|21CA]of my hand shalt thou
[GNSS|21CB]require him;


[GNSS|21CC]if I bring him
[GNSS|21CD]not unto thee,
[GNSS|21CE]and set him
[GNSS|21CF]before thee, then let me
[GNSS|21D0]bear the blame
[GNSS|21D1]for ever.


[GNSS|21D2]43,10 For except we
[GNSS|21D3]had lingered, surely we
[GNSS|21D4]had now returned
[GNSS|21D5]a second time.' 43,11
[GNSS|21D6]And their father Israel
[GNSS|21D7]said unto them: 'If it
[GNSS|21D8]be so now,
[GNSS|21D9]do this: take
[GNSS|21DA]of the choice fruits
[GNSS|21DB]of the land in your
[GNSS|21DC]vessels, and carry down
[GNSS|21DD]the man a present,
[GNSS|21DE]a little balm,
[GNSS|21DF]and a little honey, spicery
[GNSS|21E0]and ladanum, nuts,
[GNSS|21E1]and almonds;


[GNSS|21E2]43,12 and take double money
[GNSS|21E3]in your hand;


[GNSS|21E4]and the money that was
[GNSS|21E5]returned in the mouth
[GNSS|21E6]of your sacks carry back
[GNSS|21E7]in your hand;


[GNSS|21E8]peradventure it was an oversight;


[GNSS|21E9]43,13 take also your brother,
[GNSS|21EA]and arise, go
[GNSS|21EB]again unto the man;


[GNSS|21EC]43,14 and God Almighty give
[GNSS|21ED]you mercy before
[GNSS|21EE]the man, that he may
[GNSS|21EF]release unto you your other
[GNSS|21F0]brother and Benjamin.


[GNSS|21F1]And as for me,
[GNSS|21F2]if I be
[GNSS|21F3]bereaved of my children, I
[GNSS|21F4]am bereaved.' 43,15
[GNSS|21F5]And the men took that
[GNSS|21F6]present, and they took double
[GNSS|21F7]money in their hand,
[GNSS|21F8]and Benjamin;


[GNSS|21F9]and rose up,
[GNSS|21FA]and went down to Egypt,
[GNSS|21FB]and stood before Joseph.


[GNSS|21FC]43,16 And when Joseph saw
[GNSS|21FD]Benjamin with them, he
[GNSS|21FE]said to the steward
[GNSS|21FF]of his house:
[GNSS|2200]'Bring the men into
[GNSS|2201]the house, and kill
[GNSS|2202]the beasts, and prepare
[GNSS|2203]the meat;


[GNSS|2204]for the men shall dine
[GNSS|2205]with me at noon.' 43,17
[GNSS|2206]And the man did
[GNSS|2207]as Joseph bade;


[GNSS|2208]and the man brought
[GNSS|2209]the men into Joseph's house.


[GNSS|220A]43,18 And the men were
[GNSS|220B]afraid, because they were brought
[GNSS|220C]into Joseph's house;


[GNSS|220D]and they said: 'Because
[GNSS|220E]of the money that was
[GNSS|220F]returned in our sacks at
[GNSS|2210]the first time are we
[GNSS|2211]brought in; that he may
[GNSS|2212]seek occasion against us,
[GNSS|2213]and fall upon us,
[GNSS|2214]and take us
[GNSS|2215]for bondmen, and our asses.'
[GNSS|2216]43,19 And they came near
[GNSS|2217]to the steward
[GNSS|2218]of Joseph's house,
[GNSS|2219]and they spoke unto him
[GNSS|221A]at the door
[GNSS|221B]of the house, 43,20
[GNSS|221C]and said: 'Oh my lord,
[GNSS|221D]we came indeed down at
[GNSS|221E]the first time to buy
[GNSS|221F]food.


[GNSS|2220]43,21 And it came to
[GNSS|2221]pass, when we came to
[GNSS|2222]the lodging-place, that we
[GNSS|2223]opened our sacks, and, behold,
[GNSS|2224]every man's money was in
[GNSS|2225]the mouth of his sack,
[GNSS|2226]our money in full weight;


[GNSS|2227]and we have brought it
[GNSS|2228]back in our hand.


[GNSS|2229]43,22 And other money
[GNSS|222A]have we brought down in
[GNSS|222B]our hand to buy food.


[GNSS|222C]We know not
[GNSS|222D]who put our money in
[GNSS|222E]our sacks.' 43,23
[GNSS|222F]And he said: 'Peace be
[GNSS|2230]to you, fear not;


[GNSS|2231]your God, and
[GNSS|2232]the God of your father,
[GNSS|2233]hath given you treasure in
[GNSS|2234]your sacks;


[GNSS|2235]I had your money.'
[GNSS|2236]And he brought Simeon out
[GNSS|2237]unto them.


[GNSS|2238]43,24 And the man brought
[GNSS|2239]the men into Joseph's house,
[GNSS|223A]and gave them water,
[GNSS|223B]and they washed their feet;


[GNSS|223C]and he gave their asses
[GNSS|223D]provender.


[GNSS|223E]43,25 And they
[GNSS|223F]made ready the
[GNSS|2240]present against Joseph's
[GNSS|2241]coming at noon;


[GNSS|2242]for they heard that they
[GNSS|2243]should eat bread there.


[GNSS|2244]43,26 And when Joseph came
[GNSS|2245]home, they brought him
[GNSS|2246]the present which was in
[GNSS|2247]their hand into
[GNSS|2248]the house, and
[GNSS|2249]bowed down to him to
[GNSS|224A]the earth.


[GNSS|224B]43,27 And he
[GNSS|224C]asked them of their welfare,
[GNSS|224D]and said: 'Is your father
[GNSS|224E]well, the old man
[GNSS|224F]of whom ye spoke? Is
[GNSS|2250]he yet alive?' 43,28
[GNSS|2251]And they said: 'Thy servant
[GNSS|2252]our father is well, he
[GNSS|2253]is yet alive.'
[GNSS|2254]And they bowed
[GNSS|2255]the head, and
[GNSS|2256]made obeisance.


[GNSS|2257]43,29 And he
[GNSS|2258]lifted up his eyes,
[GNSS|2259]and saw Benjamin his brother,
[GNSS|225A]his mother's son,
[GNSS|225B]and said: 'Is this your
[GNSS|225C]youngest brother of
[GNSS|225D]whom ye spoke unto me?'
[GNSS|225E]And he said: 'God be
[GNSS|225F]gracious unto thee, my son.'
[GNSS|2260]43,30 And Joseph
[GNSS|2261]made haste;


[GNSS|2262]for his heart
[GNSS|2263]yearned toward his brother;


[GNSS|2264]and he sought
[GNSS|2265]where to weep;


[GNSS|2266]and he entered into his
[GNSS|2267]chamber, and wept there.


[GNSS|2268]43,31 And he
[GNSS|2269]washed his face,
[GNSS|226A]and came out;


[GNSS|226B]and he refrained himself,
[GNSS|226C]and said: 'Set on bread.'
[GNSS|226D]43,32 And they set on
[GNSS|226E]for him by himself,
[GNSS|226F]and for them
[GNSS|2270]by themselves, and
[GNSS|2271]for the Egyptians, that did
[GNSS|2272]eat with him,
[GNSS|2273]by themselves;


[GNSS|2274]because the Egyptians might
[GNSS|2275]not eat bread
[GNSS|2276]with the Hebrews;


[GNSS|2277]for that is an abomination
[GNSS|2278]unto the Egyptians.


[GNSS|2279]43,33 And they sat
[GNSS|227A]before him, the firstborn
[GNSS|227B]according to his birthright,
[GNSS|227C]and the youngest
[GNSS|227D]according to his youth;


[GNSS|227E]and the men
[GNSS|227F]marvelled one with another.


[GNSS|2280]43,34 And portions were taken
[GNSS|2281]unto them from
[GNSS|2282]before him;


[GNSS|2283]but Benjamin's portion was five
[GNSS|2284]times so much
[GNSS|2285]as any of theirs.


[GNSS|2286]And they drank,
[GNSS|2287]and were merry
[GNSS|2288]with him.


[GNSS|2289]44,1 And he
[GNSS|228A]commanded the steward
[GNSS|228B]of his house, saying: 'Fill
[GNSS|228C]the men's sacks
[GNSS|228D]with food, as much
[GNSS|228E]as they can carry,
[GNSS|228F]and put every man's money
[GNSS|2290]in his sack's mouth.


[GNSS|2291]44,2 And put my goblet,
[GNSS|2292]the silver goblet, in
[GNSS|2293]the sack's mouth
[GNSS|2294]of the youngest,
[GNSS|2295]and his corn money.'
[GNSS|2296]And he did
[GNSS|2297]according to the word that
[GNSS|2298]Joseph had spoken.


[GNSS|2299]44,3 As soon
[GNSS|229A]as the morning was light,
[GNSS|229B]the men were sent away,
[GNSS|229C]they and their asses.


[GNSS|229D]44,4 And when they were
[GNSS|229E]gone out of
[GNSS|229F]the city, and were
[GNSS|22A0]not yet far off, Joseph
[GNSS|22A1]said unto his steward: 'Up,
[GNSS|22A2]follow after the men;


[GNSS|22A3]and when thou dost overtake
[GNSS|22A4]them, say unto them:
[GNSS|22A5]Wherefore have ye
[GNSS|22A6]rewarded evil for good? 44,5
[GNSS|22A7]Is not this it in
[GNSS|22A8]which my lord drinketh,
[GNSS|22A9]and whereby he
[GNSS|22AA]indeed divineth? ye
[GNSS|22AB]have done evil in
[GNSS|22AC]so doing.' 44,6
[GNSS|22AD]And he overtook them,
[GNSS|22AE]and he spoke unto them
[GNSS|22AF]these words.


[GNSS|22B0]44,7 And they
[GNSS|22B1]said unto him: 'Wherefore speaketh
[GNSS|22B2]my lord such words
[GNSS|22B3]as these? Far be it
[GNSS|22B4]from thy servants that they
[GNSS|22B5]should do such
[GNSS|22B6]a thing.


[GNSS|22B7]44,8 Behold, the money,
[GNSS|22B8]which we found in our
[GNSS|22B9]sacks' mouths, we brought back
[GNSS|22BA]unto thee out
[GNSS|22BB]of the land
[GNSS|22BC]of Canaan;


[GNSS|22BD]how then should we steal
[GNSS|22BE]out of thy lord's house
[GNSS|22BF]silver or gold? 44,9
[GNSS|22C0]With whomsoever of thy servants
[GNSS|22C1]it be found, let him
[GNSS|22C2]die, and we
[GNSS|22C3]also will be my lord's
[GNSS|22C4]bondmen.' 44,10 And he said:
[GNSS|22C5]'Now also let it be
[GNSS|22C6]according unto your words: he
[GNSS|22C7]with whom it is found
[GNSS|22C8]shall be my bondman;


[GNSS|22C9]and ye shall be blameless.'
[GNSS|22CA]44,11 Then they hastened,
[GNSS|22CB]and took down every man
[GNSS|22CC]his sack to
[GNSS|22CD]the ground, and
[GNSS|22CE]opened every man his sack.


[GNSS|22CF]44,12 And he searched,
[GNSS|22D0]beginning at the eldest,
[GNSS|22D1]and leaving off at
[GNSS|22D2]the youngest;


[GNSS|22D3]and the goblet was found
[GNSS|22D4]in Benjamin's sack.


[GNSS|22D5]44,13 And they rent their
[GNSS|22D6]clothes, and laded every man
[GNSS|22D7]his ass, and
[GNSS|22D8]returned to the city.


[GNSS|22D9]44,14 And Judah
[GNSS|22DA]and his brethren came to
[GNSS|22DB]Joseph's house, and he was
[GNSS|22DC]yet there;


[GNSS|22DD]and they fell
[GNSS|22DE]before him on
[GNSS|22DF]the ground.


[GNSS|22E0]44,15 And Joseph
[GNSS|22E1]said unto them: 'What deed
[GNSS|22E2]is this that ye
[GNSS|22E3]have done? know ye
[GNSS|22E4]not that such
[GNSS|22E5]a man as I
[GNSS|22E6]will indeed divine?' 44,16
[GNSS|22E7]And Judah said: 'What shall
[GNSS|22E8]we say unto my lord?
[GNSS|22E9]what shall we speak?
[GNSS|22EA]or how shall we clear
[GNSS|22EB]ourselves? God hath found out
[GNSS|22EC]the iniquity of thy servants;


[GNSS|22ED]behold, we are my lord's
[GNSS|22EE]bondmen, both we,
[GNSS|22EF]and he also in
[GNSS|22F0]whose hand the cup is
[GNSS|22F1]found.' 44,17 And he said:
[GNSS|22F2]'Far be it from me
[GNSS|22F3]that I should
[GNSS|22F4]do so; the man in
[GNSS|22F5]whose hand the goblet is
[GNSS|22F6]found, he shall be my
[GNSS|22F7]bondman;


[GNSS|22F8]but as for you,
[GNSS|22F9]get you up in peace
[GNSS|22FA]unto your father.' {S} 44,18
[GNSS|22FB]Then Judah came near unto
[GNSS|22FC]him, and said: 'Oh my
[GNSS|22FD]lord, let thy servant, I
[GNSS|22FE]pray thee, speak
[GNSS|22FF]a word in my lord's
[GNSS|2300]ears, and let
[GNSS|2301]not thine anger burn against
[GNSS|2302]thy servant;


[GNSS|2303]for thou art
[GNSS|2304]even as Pharaoh.


[GNSS|2305]44,19 My lord
[GNSS|2306]asked his servants, saying:
[GNSS|2307]Have ye a father,
[GNSS|2308]or a brother? 44,20
[GNSS|2309]And we said unto my
[GNSS|230A]lord: We have
[GNSS|230B]a father, an old man,
[GNSS|230C]and a child
[GNSS|230D]of his old age,
[GNSS|230E]a little one;


[GNSS|230F]and his brother is dead,
[GNSS|2310]and he alone is left
[GNSS|2311]of his mother,
[GNSS|2312]and his father loveth him.


[GNSS|2313]44,21 And thou saidst unto
[GNSS|2314]thy servants: Bring him down
[GNSS|2315]unto me, that I may
[GNSS|2316]set mine eyes upon him.


[GNSS|2317]44,22 And we
[GNSS|2318]said unto my lord:
[GNSS|2319]The lad cannot leave his
[GNSS|231A]father;


[GNSS|231B]for if he should leave
[GNSS|231C]his father, his father
[GNSS|231D]would die.


[GNSS|231E]44,23 And thou saidst unto
[GNSS|231F]thy servants: Except your youngest
[GNSS|2320]brother come down
[GNSS|2321]with you, ye shall see
[GNSS|2322]my face no more.


[GNSS|2323]44,24 And it came to
[GNSS|2324]pass when we came up
[GNSS|2325]unto thy servant my father,
[GNSS|2326]we told him
[GNSS|2327]the words of my lord.


[GNSS|2328]44,25 And our father said:
[GNSS|2329]Go again, buy us
[GNSS|232A]a little food.


[GNSS|232B]44,26 And we said: We
[GNSS|232C]cannot go down;


[GNSS|232D]if our youngest brother be
[GNSS|232E]with us, then
[GNSS|232F]will we go down;


[GNSS|2330]for we may
[GNSS|2331]not see the man's face,
[GNSS|2332]except our youngest brother be
[GNSS|2333]with us. 44,27
[GNSS|2334]And thy servant my father
[GNSS|2335]said unto us: Ye know
[GNSS|2336]that my wife bore me
[GNSS|2337]two sons;


[GNSS|2338]44,28 and the one
[GNSS|2339]went out from me,
[GNSS|233A]and I said: Surely he
[GNSS|233B]is torn in pieces;


[GNSS|233C]and I have
[GNSS|233D]not seen him since;


[GNSS|233E]44,29 and if ye take
[GNSS|233F]this one also from me,
[GNSS|2340]and harm befall him, ye
[GNSS|2341]will bring down my gray
[GNSS|2342]hairs with sorrow to
[GNSS|2343]the grave.


[GNSS|2344]44,30 Now therefore
[GNSS|2345]when I come to thy
[GNSS|2346]servant my father,
[GNSS|2347]and the lad is
[GNSS|2348]not with us;
[GNSS|2349]seeing that his soul is
[GNSS|234A]bound up with
[GNSS|234B]the lad's soul;


[GNSS|234C]44,31 it will come to
[GNSS|234D]pass, when he seeth that
[GNSS|234E]the lad is
[GNSS|234F]not with us, that he
[GNSS|2350]will die;


[GNSS|2351]and thy servants
[GNSS|2352]will bring down
[GNSS|2353]the gray hairs
[GNSS|2354]of thy servant our father
[GNSS|2355]with sorrow to
[GNSS|2356]the grave.


[GNSS|2357]44,32 For thy servant became
[GNSS|2358]surety for the lad unto
[GNSS|2359]my father, saying:
[GNSS|235A]If I bring him
[GNSS|235B]not unto thee,
[GNSS|235C]then shall I bear
[GNSS|235D]the blame to my father
[GNSS|235E]for ever.


[GNSS|235F]44,33 Now therefore, let thy
[GNSS|2360]servant, I pray thee, abide
[GNSS|2361]instead of the lad
[GNSS|2362]a bondman to my lord;


[GNSS|2363]and let the lad
[GNSS|2364]go up with his brethren.


[GNSS|2365]44,34 For how shall I
[GNSS|2366]go up to my father,
[GNSS|2367]if the lad be
[GNSS|2368]not with me?
[GNSS|2369]lest I look upon
[GNSS|236A]the evil that shall come
[GNSS|236B]on my father.' 45,1
[GNSS|236C]Then Joseph could
[GNSS|236D]not refrain himself
[GNSS|236E]before all them that stood
[GNSS|236F]by him;


[GNSS|2370]and he cried: 'Cause every
[GNSS|2371]man to go out from
[GNSS|2372]me.' And there stood
[GNSS|2373]no man with him,
[GNSS|2374]while Joseph made himself known
[GNSS|2375]unto his brethren.


[GNSS|2376]45,2 And he wept aloud;


[GNSS|2377]and the Egyptians heard,
[GNSS|2378]and the house
[GNSS|2379]of Pharaoh heard.


[GNSS|237A]45,3 And Joseph
[GNSS|237B]said unto his brethren: 'I
[GNSS|237C]am Joseph;


[GNSS|237D]doth my father
[GNSS|237E]yet live?' And his brethren
[GNSS|237F]could not answer him;


[GNSS|2380]for they were
[GNSS|2381]affrighted at his presence.


[GNSS|2382]45,4 And Joseph
[GNSS|2383]said unto his brethren: 'Come
[GNSS|2384]near to me, I pray
[GNSS|2385]you.' And they came near.


[GNSS|2386]And he said: 'I am
[GNSS|2387]Joseph your brother,
[GNSS|2388]whom ye sold into Egypt.


[GNSS|2389]45,5 And now be
[GNSS|238A]not grieved, nor angry
[GNSS|238B]with yourselves, that ye sold
[GNSS|238C]me hither;


[GNSS|238D]for God did send me
[GNSS|238E]before you to preserve life.


[GNSS|238F]45,6 For these two years
[GNSS|2390]hath the famine been in
[GNSS|2391]the land;


[GNSS|2392]and there are
[GNSS|2393]yet five years, in
[GNSS|2394]which there shall be
[GNSS|2395]neither plowing nor harvest.


[GNSS|2396]45,7 And God sent me
[GNSS|2397]before you to give you
[GNSS|2398]a remnant on
[GNSS|2399]the earth, and to save
[GNSS|239A]you alive for
[GNSS|239B]a great deliverance.


[GNSS|239C]45,8 So now it was
[GNSS|239D]not you that sent me
[GNSS|239E]hither, but God;


[GNSS|239F]and He hath
[GNSS|23A0]made me a father to
[GNSS|23A1]Pharaoh, and lord
[GNSS|23A2]of all his house,
[GNSS|23A3]and ruler over all
[GNSS|23A4]the land of Egypt.


[GNSS|23A5]45,9 Hasten ye,
[GNSS|23A6]and go up to my
[GNSS|23A7]father, and say unto him:
[GNSS|23A8]Thus saith thy son Joseph:
[GNSS|23A9]God hath made me lord
[GNSS|23AA]of all Egypt;


[GNSS|23AB]come down unto me, tarry
[GNSS|23AC]not.


[GNSS|23AD]45,10 And thou shalt dwell
[GNSS|23AE]in the land
[GNSS|23AF]of Goshen, and thou shalt
[GNSS|23B0]be near unto me, thou,
[GNSS|23B1]and thy children,
[GNSS|23B2]and thy children's children,
[GNSS|23B3]and thy flocks,
[GNSS|23B4]and thy herds,
[GNSS|23B5]and all that thou hast;


[GNSS|23B6]45,11 and there
[GNSS|23B7]will I sustain thee;


[GNSS|23B8]for there are
[GNSS|23B9]yet five years
[GNSS|23BA]of famine;


[GNSS|23BB]lest thou come to poverty,
[GNSS|23BC]thou, and thy household,
[GNSS|23BD]and all that thou hast.


[GNSS|23BE]45,12 And, behold, your eyes
[GNSS|23BF]see, and the eyes
[GNSS|23C0]of my brother Benjamin, that
[GNSS|23C1]it is my mouth that
[GNSS|23C2]speaketh unto you.


[GNSS|23C3]45,13 And ye shall tell
[GNSS|23C4]my father of all my
[GNSS|23C5]glory in Egypt,
[GNSS|23C6]and of all that ye
[GNSS|23C7]have seen;


[GNSS|23C8]and ye shall hasten
[GNSS|23C9]and bring down my father
[GNSS|23CA]hither.' 45,14 And he fell
[GNSS|23CB]upon his brother Benjamin's neck,
[GNSS|23CC]and wept;


[GNSS|23CD]and Benjamin wept upon his
[GNSS|23CE]neck.


[GNSS|23CF]45,15 And he
[GNSS|23D0]kissed all his brethren,
[GNSS|23D1]and wept upon them;


[GNSS|23D2]and after that his brethren
[GNSS|23D3]talked with him.


[GNSS|23D4]45,16 And the report thereof
[GNSS|23D5]was heard in Pharaoh's house,
[GNSS|23D6]saying: 'Joseph's brethren are come';


[GNSS|23D7]and it pleased Pharaoh well,
[GNSS|23D8]and his servants.


[GNSS|23D9]45,17 And Pharaoh
[GNSS|23DA]said unto Joseph: 'Say unto
[GNSS|23DB]thy brethren: This
[GNSS|23DC]do ye: lade your beasts,
[GNSS|23DD]and go, get you unto
[GNSS|23DE]the land of Canaan;


[GNSS|23DF]45,18 and take your father
[GNSS|23E0]and your households,
[GNSS|23E1]and come unto me;
[GNSS|23E2]and I will give you
[GNSS|23E3]the good of
[GNSS|23E4]the land of Egypt,
[GNSS|23E5]and ye shall eat
[GNSS|23E6]the fat of
[GNSS|23E7]the land.


[GNSS|23E8]45,19 Now thou art commanded,
[GNSS|23E9]this do ye: take you
[GNSS|23EA]wagons out of
[GNSS|23EB]the land of Egypt
[GNSS|23EC]for your little ones,
[GNSS|23ED]and for your wives,
[GNSS|23EE]and bring your father,
[GNSS|23EF]and come.


[GNSS|23F0]45,20 Also regard
[GNSS|23F1]not your stuff;


[GNSS|23F2]for the good things
[GNSS|23F3]of all the land
[GNSS|23F4]of Egypt are yours.' 45,21
[GNSS|23F5]And the sons
[GNSS|23F6]of Israel did so;
[GNSS|23F7]and Joseph gave them wagons,
[GNSS|23F8]according to the commandment
[GNSS|23F9]of Pharaoh, and gave them
[GNSS|23FA]provision for the way.


[GNSS|23FB]45,22 To all
[GNSS|23FC]of them he gave each
[GNSS|23FD]man changes of raiment;


[GNSS|23FE]but to Benjamin he gave
[GNSS|23FF]three hundred shekels
[GNSS|2400]of silver, and five changes
[GNSS|2401]of raiment.


[GNSS|2402]45,23 And to his father
[GNSS|2403]he sent in
[GNSS|2404]like manner ten asses laden
[GNSS|2405]with the good things
[GNSS|2406]of Egypt, and ten she-asses
[GNSS|2407]laden with corn
[GNSS|2408]and bread and victual
[GNSS|2409]for his father
[GNSS|240A]by the way.


[GNSS|240B]45,24 So he sent his
[GNSS|240C]brethren away, and they departed;


[GNSS|240D]and he said unto them:
[GNSS|240E]'See that ye fall
[GNSS|240F]not out by
[GNSS|2410]the way.' 45,25
[GNSS|2411]And they went up out
[GNSS|2412]of Egypt, and came into
[GNSS|2413]the land of Canaan unto
[GNSS|2414]Jacob their father.


[GNSS|2415]45,26 And they told him,
[GNSS|2416]saying: 'Joseph is
[GNSS|2417]yet alive, and he is
[GNSS|2418]ruler over all
[GNSS|2419]the land of Egypt.'
[GNSS|241A]And his heart fainted,
[GNSS|241B]for he believed them not.


[GNSS|241C]45,27 And they told him
[GNSS|241D]all the words
[GNSS|241E]of Joseph, which he
[GNSS|241F]had said unto them;


[GNSS|2420]and when he saw
[GNSS|2421]the wagons which Joseph
[GNSS|2422]had sent to carry him,
[GNSS|2423]the spirit of Jacob their
[GNSS|2424]father revived.


[GNSS|2425]45,28 And Israel said: 'It
[GNSS|2426]is enough;


[GNSS|2427]Joseph my son is
[GNSS|2428]yet alive;


[GNSS|2429]I will go
[GNSS|242A]and see him
[GNSS|242B]before I die.' 46,1
[GNSS|242C]And Israel took his journey
[GNSS|242D]with all that he had,
[GNSS|242E]and came to Beer-sheba,
[GNSS|242F]and offered sacrifices unto
[GNSS|2430]the God of his father
[GNSS|2431]Isaac.


[GNSS|2432]46,2 And God spoke unto
[GNSS|2433]Israel in the visions
[GNSS|2434]of the night,
[GNSS|2435]and said: 'Jacob, Jacob.'
[GNSS|2436]And he said: 'Here am
[GNSS|2437]I.' 46,3 And He said:
[GNSS|2438]'I am God,
[GNSS|2439]the God of thy father;


[GNSS|243A]fear not to
[GNSS|243B]go down into Egypt;


[GNSS|243C]for I will there
[GNSS|243D]make of thee
[GNSS|243E]a great nation.


[GNSS|243F]46,4 I will
[GNSS|2440]go down with thee into
[GNSS|2441]Egypt;


[GNSS|2442]and I will
[GNSS|2443]also surely bring thee up
[GNSS|2444]again;


[GNSS|2445]and Joseph shall put his
[GNSS|2446]hand upon thine eyes.' 46,5
[GNSS|2447]And Jacob rose up from
[GNSS|2448]Beer-sheba;


[GNSS|2449]and the sons
[GNSS|244A]of Israel carried Jacob their
[GNSS|244B]father, and their little ones,
[GNSS|244C]and their wives, in
[GNSS|244D]the wagons which Pharaoh
[GNSS|244E]had sent to carry him.


[GNSS|244F]46,6 And they took their
[GNSS|2450]cattle, and their goods,
[GNSS|2451]which they had gotten in
[GNSS|2452]the land of Canaan,
[GNSS|2453]and came into Egypt, Jacob,
[GNSS|2454]and all his seed
[GNSS|2455]with him;


[GNSS|2456]46,7 his sons,
[GNSS|2457]and his sons' sons
[GNSS|2458]with him, his daughters,
[GNSS|2459]and his sons' daughters,
[GNSS|245A]and all his seed brought
[GNSS|245B]he with him into Egypt.


[GNSS|245C]{S} 46,8 And these are
[GNSS|245D]the names of
[GNSS|245E]the children of Israel,
[GNSS|245F]who came into Egypt, Jacob
[GNSS|2460]and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's

[GNSS|2473]but Er and Onan died
[GNSS|2474]in the land
[GNSS|2475]of Canaan.


[GNSS|2476]And the sons

[GNSS|2485]all the souls
[GNSS|2486]of his sons

[GNSS|24BB]46,26 All the souls

[GNSS|24BF]besides Jacob's sons' wives, all
[GNSS|24C0]the souls were threescore
[GNSS|24C1]and six.


[GNSS|24C2]46,27 And the sons

[GNSS|24C4]to him in Egypt, were
[GNSS|24C5]two souls;


[GNSS|24C6]all the souls

[GNSS|24C9]Egypt, were threescore
[GNSS|24CA]and ten.


[GNSS|24CB]{S} 46,28 And he sent
[GNSS|24CC]Judah before him unto Joseph,
[GNSS|24CD]to show the way
[GNSS|24CE]before him unto Goshen;


[GNSS|24CF]and they came into
[GNSS|24D0]the land of Goshen.


[GNSS|24D1]46,29 And Joseph
[GNSS|24D2]made ready his chariot,
[GNSS|24D3]and went up to meet
[GNSS|24D4]Israel his father, to Goshen;


[GNSS|24D5]and he presented himself unto
[GNSS|24D6]him, and fell on his
[GNSS|24D7]neck, and wept on his
[GNSS|24D8]neck a good while.


[GNSS|24D9]46,30 And Israel
[GNSS|24DA]said unto Joseph: 'Now let
[GNSS|24DB]me die, since I
[GNSS|24DC]have seen thy face, that
[GNSS|24DD]thou art yet alive.' 46,31
[GNSS|24DE]And Joseph said unto his
[GNSS|24DF]brethren, and unto his father's
[GNSS|24E0]house: 'I will
[GNSS|24E1]go up, and tell Pharaoh,
[GNSS|24E2]and will say unto him:
[GNSS|24E3]My brethren, and my father's
[GNSS|24E4]house, who were in
[GNSS|24E5]the land of Canaan, are
[GNSS|24E6]come unto me; 46,32
[GNSS|24E7]and the men are shepherds,
[GNSS|24E8]for they have been keepers
[GNSS|24E9]of cattle;


[GNSS|24EA]and they have brought their
[GNSS|24EB]flocks, and their herds,
[GNSS|24EC]and all that they have.


[GNSS|24ED]46,33 And it shall come
[GNSS|24EE]to pass, when Pharaoh shall
[GNSS|24EF]call you, and shall say:
[GNSS|24F0]What is your occupation? 46,34
[GNSS|24F1]that ye shall say: Thy
[GNSS|24F2]servants have been keepers
[GNSS|24F3]of cattle from our youth
[GNSS|24F4]even until now, both we,
[GNSS|24F5]and our fathers;


[GNSS|24F6]that ye may dwell in
[GNSS|24F7]the land of Goshen;


[GNSS|24F8]for every shepherd is an
[GNSS|24F9]abomination unto the Egyptians.' 47,1
[GNSS|24FA]Then Joseph went in
[GNSS|24FB]and told Pharaoh,
[GNSS|24FC]and said: 'My father
[GNSS|24FD]and my brethren,
[GNSS|24FE]and their flocks,
[GNSS|24FF]and their herds,
[GNSS|2500]and all that they have,
[GNSS|2501]are come out
[GNSS|2502]of the land
[GNSS|2503]of Canaan;


[GNSS|2504]and, behold, they are in
[GNSS|2505]the land of Goshen.' 47,2
[GNSS|2506]And from among his brethren
[GNSS|2507]he took five men,
[GNSS|2508]and presented them unto Pharaoh.


[GNSS|2509]47,3 And Pharaoh
[GNSS|250A]said unto his brethren: 'What
[GNSS|250B]is your occupation?'
[GNSS|250C]And they said unto Pharaoh:
[GNSS|250D]'Thy servants are shepherds, both
[GNSS|250E]we, and our fathers.' 47,4
[GNSS|250F]And they said unto Pharaoh:
[GNSS|2510]'To sojourn in
[GNSS|2511]the land are we come;


[GNSS|2512]for there is
[GNSS|2513]no pasture for thy servants'
[GNSS|2514]flocks;


[GNSS|2515]for the famine is sore
[GNSS|2516]in the land
[GNSS|2517]of Canaan.


[GNSS|2518]Now therefore, we pray thee,
[GNSS|2519]let thy servants dwell in
[GNSS|251A]the land of Goshen.' 47,5
[GNSS|251B]And Pharaoh spoke unto Joseph,
[GNSS|251C]saying: 'Thy father
[GNSS|251D]and thy brethren are come
[GNSS|251E]unto thee;


[GNSS|251F]47,6 the land
[GNSS|2520]of Egypt is
[GNSS|2521]before thee;


[GNSS|2522]in the best
[GNSS|2523]of the land
[GNSS|2524]make thy father
[GNSS|2525]and thy brethren to dwell;


[GNSS|2526]in the land
[GNSS|2527]of Goshen let them dwell.


[GNSS|2528]And if thou knowest any
[GNSS|2529]able men among them,
[GNSS|252A]then make them rulers
[GNSS|252B]over my cattle.' 47,7
[GNSS|252C]And Joseph brought in Jacob
[GNSS|252D]his father, and set him
[GNSS|252E]before Pharaoh.


[GNSS|252F]And Jacob blessed Pharaoh.


[GNSS|2530]47,8 And Pharaoh
[GNSS|2531]said unto Jacob: 'How many
[GNSS|2532]are the days
[GNSS|2533]of the years
[GNSS|2534]of thy life?' 47,9
[GNSS|2535]And Jacob said unto Pharaoh:
[GNSS|2536]'The days of
[GNSS|2537]the years of my sojournings
[GNSS|2538]are a hundred
[GNSS|2539]and thirty years;


[GNSS|253A]few and evil
[GNSS|253B]have been the days
[GNSS|253C]of the years
[GNSS|253D]of my life,
[GNSS|253E]and they have
[GNSS|253F]not attained unto
[GNSS|2540]the days of
[GNSS|2541]the years of
[GNSS|2542]the life of my fathers
[GNSS|2543]in the days
[GNSS|2544]of their sojournings.' 47,10
[GNSS|2545]And Jacob blessed Pharaoh,
[GNSS|2546]and went out from
[GNSS|2547]the presence of Pharaoh.


[GNSS|2548]47,11 And Joseph
[GNSS|2549]placed his father
[GNSS|254A]and his brethren,
[GNSS|254B]and gave them
[GNSS|254C]a possession in
[GNSS|254D]the land of Egypt, in
[GNSS|254E]the best of
[GNSS|254F]the land, in
[GNSS|2550]the land of Rameses,
[GNSS|2551]as Pharaoh had commanded.


[GNSS|2552]47,12 And Joseph
[GNSS|2553]sustained his father,
[GNSS|2554]and his brethren,
[GNSS|2555]and all his father's household,
[GNSS|2556]with bread, according to
[GNSS|2557]the want of their little
[GNSS|2558]ones.


[GNSS|2559]47,13 And there was
[GNSS|255A]no bread in all
[GNSS|255B]the land;


[GNSS|255C]for the famine was very
[GNSS|255D]sore, so that
[GNSS|255E]the land of Egypt
[GNSS|255F]and the land
[GNSS|2560]of Canaan languished
[GNSS|2561]by reason of
[GNSS|2562]the famine.


[GNSS|2563]47,14 And Joseph
[GNSS|2564]gathered up all
[GNSS|2565]the money that was found
[GNSS|2566]in the land
[GNSS|2567]of Egypt, and in
[GNSS|2568]the land of Canaan,
[GNSS|2569]for the corn
[GNSS|256A]which they bought;


[GNSS|256B]and Joseph brought
[GNSS|256C]the money into Pharaoh's house.


[GNSS|256D]47,15 And when
[GNSS|256E]the money was all spent
[GNSS|256F]in the land
[GNSS|2570]of Egypt, and in
[GNSS|2571]the land of Canaan, all
[GNSS|2572]the Egyptians came unto Joseph,
[GNSS|2573]and said: 'Give us bread;


[GNSS|2574]for why should we die
[GNSS|2575]in thy presence?
[GNSS|2576]for our money faileth.' 47,16
[GNSS|2577]And Joseph said: 'Give your
[GNSS|2578]cattle, and I
[GNSS|2579]will give you [bread]
[GNSS|257A]for your cattle,
[GNSS|257B]if money fail.' 47,17
[GNSS|257C]And they brought their cattle
[GNSS|257D]unto Joseph.


[GNSS|257E]And Joseph gave them bread
[GNSS|257F]in exchange for
[GNSS|2580]the horses, and
[GNSS|2581]for the flocks,
[GNSS|2582]and for the herds,
[GNSS|2583]and for the asses;


[GNSS|2584]and he fed them
[GNSS|2585]with bread in exchange
[GNSS|2586]for all their cattle
[GNSS|2587]for that year.


[GNSS|2588]47,18 And when that year
[GNSS|2589]was ended, they came unto
[GNSS|258A]him the second year,
[GNSS|258B]and said unto him: 'We
[GNSS|258C]will not hide from my
[GNSS|258D]lord, how that our money
[GNSS|258E]is all spent;


[GNSS|258F]and the herds
[GNSS|2590]of cattle are my lord's;


[GNSS|2591]there is nought left in
[GNSS|2592]the sight of my lord,
[GNSS|2593]but our bodies,
[GNSS|2594]and our lands.


[GNSS|2595]47,19 Wherefore should we die
[GNSS|2596]before thine eyes, both we
[GNSS|2597]and our land? buy us
[GNSS|2598]and our land
[GNSS|2599]for bread, and we
[GNSS|259A]and our land
[GNSS|259B]will be bondmen unto Pharaoh;


[GNSS|259C]and give us seed, that
[GNSS|259D]we may live,
[GNSS|259E]and not die,
[GNSS|259F]and that the land be
[GNSS|25A0]not desolate.' 47,20
[GNSS|25A1]So Joseph bought all
[GNSS|25A2]the land of Egypt
[GNSS|25A3]for Pharaoh;


[GNSS|25A4]for the Egyptians sold every
[GNSS|25A5]man his field,
[GNSS|25A6]because the famine was sore
[GNSS|25A7]upon them;


[GNSS|25A8]and the land became Pharaoh's.


[GNSS|25A9]47,21 And as
[GNSS|25AA]for the people, he
[GNSS|25AB]removed them city
[GNSS|25AC]by city, from one end
[GNSS|25AD]of the border
[GNSS|25AE]of Egypt even to
[GNSS|25AF]the other end thereof.


[GNSS|25B0]47,22 Only the land
[GNSS|25B1]of the priests bought he
[GNSS|25B2]not, for the priests
[GNSS|25B3]had a portion from Pharaoh,
[GNSS|25B4]and did eat their portion
[GNSS|25B5]which Pharaoh gave them;


[GNSS|25B6]wherefore they sold
[GNSS|25B7]not their land.


[GNSS|25B8]47,23 Then Joseph
[GNSS|25B9]said unto the people: 'Behold,
[GNSS|25BA]I have bought you this
[GNSS|25BB]day and your land
[GNSS|25BC]for Pharaoh.


[GNSS|25BD]Lo, here is seed
[GNSS|25BE]for you, and ye shall
[GNSS|25BF]sow the land.


[GNSS|25C0]47,24 And it shall come
[GNSS|25C1]to pass at
[GNSS|25C2]the ingatherings, that ye shall
[GNSS|25C3]give a fifth unto Pharaoh,
[GNSS|25C4]and four parts shall be
[GNSS|25C5]your own, for seed
[GNSS|25C6]of the field,
[GNSS|25C7]and for your food,
[GNSS|25C8]and for them
[GNSS|25C9]of your households,
[GNSS|25CA]and for food
[GNSS|25CB]for your little ones.' 47,25
[GNSS|25CC]And they said: 'Thou hast
[GNSS|25CD]saved our lives.


[GNSS|25CE]Let us find favour in
[GNSS|25CF]the sight of my lord,
[GNSS|25D0]and we will be Pharaoh's
[GNSS|25D1]bondmen.' 47,26 And Joseph
[GNSS|25D2]made it a statute
[GNSS|25D3]concerning the land
[GNSS|25D4]of Egypt unto this day,
[GNSS|25D5]that Pharaoh should
[GNSS|25D6]have the fifth;


[GNSS|25D7]only the land
[GNSS|25D8]of the priests alone became
[GNSS|25D9]not Pharaoh's.


[GNSS|25DA]47,27 And Israel dwelt in
[GNSS|25DB]the land of Egypt, in
[GNSS|25DC]the land of Goshen;


[GNSS|25DD]and they got them possessions
[GNSS|25DE]therein, and were fruitful,
[GNSS|25DF]and multiplied exceedingly.


[GNSS|25E0]47,28 And Jacob
[GNSS|25E1]lived in the land
[GNSS|25E2]of Egypt seventeen years;


[GNSS|25E3]so the days
[GNSS|25E4]of Jacob, the years
[GNSS|25E5]of his life, were
[GNSS|25E6]a hundred forty
[GNSS|25E7]and seven years.


[GNSS|25E8]47,29 And the
[GNSS|25E9]time drew near that Israel
[GNSS|25EA]must die;


[GNSS|25EB]and he called his son
[GNSS|25EC]Joseph, and said unto him:
[GNSS|25ED]'If now I
[GNSS|25EE]have found favour in thy
[GNSS|25EF]sight, put, I pray thee,
[GNSS|25F0]thy hand under my thigh,
[GNSS|25F1]and deal kindly
[GNSS|25F2]and truly with me; bury
[GNSS|25F3]me not, I pray thee,
[GNSS|25F4]in Egypt.


[GNSS|25F5]47,30 But when I sleep
[GNSS|25F6]with my fathers, thou shalt
[GNSS|25F7]carry me out
[GNSS|25F8]of Egypt, and bury me
[GNSS|25F9]in their burying-place.'
[GNSS|25FA]And he said: 'I
[GNSS|25FB]will do as thou hast
[GNSS|25FC]said.' 47,31 And he said:
[GNSS|25FD]'Swear unto me.'
[GNSS|25FE]And he swore unto him.


[GNSS|25FF]And Israel bowed down upon
[GNSS|2600]the bed's head.


[GNSS|2601]{P}  48,1
[GNSS|2602]And it came to pass
[GNSS|2603]after these things, that one
[GNSS|2604]said to Joseph: 'Behold, thy
[GNSS|2605]father is sick.'
[GNSS|2606]And he took
[GNSS|2607]with him his two sons,
[GNSS|2608]Manasseh and Ephraim.


[GNSS|2609]48,2 And one told Jacob,
[GNSS|260A]and said: 'Behold, thy son
[GNSS|260B]Joseph cometh unto thee.'
[GNSS|260C]And Israel strengthened himself,
[GNSS|260D]and sat upon
[GNSS|260E]the bed.


[GNSS|260F]48,3 And Jacob
[GNSS|2610]said unto Joseph: 'God Almighty
[GNSS|2611]appeared unto me at Luz
[GNSS|2612]in the land
[GNSS|2613]of Canaan, and
[GNSS|2614]blessed me, 48,4
[GNSS|2615]and said unto me: Behold,
[GNSS|2616]I will make thee fruitful,
[GNSS|2617]and multiply thee,
[GNSS|2618]and I will
[GNSS|2619]make of thee
[GNSS|261A]a company of peoples;


[GNSS|261B]and will give this land
[GNSS|261C]to thy seed
[GNSS|261D]after thee for an
[GNSS|261E]everlasting possession.


[GNSS|261F]48,5 And now thy two
[GNSS|2620]sons, who were born unto
[GNSS|2621]thee in the land
[GNSS|2622]of Egypt before I came
[GNSS|2623]unto thee into Egypt, are
[GNSS|2624]mine;


[GNSS|2625]Ephraim and Manasseh,
[GNSS|2626]even as Reuben
[GNSS|2627]and Simeon, shall be mine.


[GNSS|2628]48,6 And thy issue, that
[GNSS|2629]thou begettest after them, shall
[GNSS|262A]be thine;


[GNSS|262B]they shall be
[GNSS|262C]called after the name
[GNSS|262D]of their brethren in their
[GNSS|262E]inheritance.


[GNSS|262F]48,7 And as
[GNSS|2630]for me, when I came
[GNSS|2631]from Paddan, Rachel died unto
[GNSS|2632]me in the land
[GNSS|2633]of Canaan in
[GNSS|2634]the way, when there was
[GNSS|2635]still some way to come
[GNSS|2636]unto Ephrath;


[GNSS|2637]and I buried her there
[GNSS|2638]in the way to Ephrath-the
[GNSS|2639]same is Beth-lehem.' 48,8
[GNSS|263A]And Israel beheld Joseph's sons,
[GNSS|263B]and said: 'Who are these?'
[GNSS|263C]48,9 And Joseph
[GNSS|263D]said unto his father: 'They
[GNSS|263E]are my sons,
[GNSS|263F]whom God hath given me
[GNSS|2640]here.' And he said:
[GNSS|2641]'Bring them, I pray thee,
[GNSS|2642]unto me, and I
[GNSS|2643]will bless them.' 48,10
[GNSS|2644]Now the eyes
[GNSS|2645]of Israel were dim
[GNSS|2646]for age, so that he
[GNSS|2647]could not see.


[GNSS|2648]And he brought them near
[GNSS|2649]unto him;


[GNSS|264A]and he kissed them,
[GNSS|264B]and embraced them.


[GNSS|264C]48,11 And Israel
[GNSS|264D]said unto Joseph: 'I
[GNSS|264E]had not thought to see
[GNSS|264F]thy face;


[GNSS|2650]and, lo, God hath let
[GNSS|2651]me see thy seed also.'
[GNSS|2652]48,12 And Joseph brought them
[GNSS|2653]out from between his knees;


[GNSS|2654]and he fell down on
[GNSS|2655]his face to
[GNSS|2656]the earth.


[GNSS|2657]48,13 And Joseph took them
[GNSS|2658]both, Ephraim in his right
[GNSS|2659]hand toward Israel's left hand,
[GNSS|265A]and Manasseh in his left
[GNSS|265B]hand toward Israel's right hand,
[GNSS|265C]and brought them near unto
[GNSS|265D]him.


[GNSS|265E]48,14 And Israel
[GNSS|265F]stretched out his right hand,
[GNSS|2660]and laid it upon Ephraim's
[GNSS|2661]head, who was
[GNSS|2662]the younger, and his left
[GNSS|2663]hand upon Manasseh's head,
[GNSS|2664]guiding his hands wittingly;


[GNSS|2665]for Manasseh was
[GNSS|2666]the first-born.


[GNSS|2667]48,15 And he
[GNSS|2668]blessed Joseph, and said: 'The
[GNSS|2669]God before whom my fathers
[GNSS|266A]Abraham and Isaac did walk,
[GNSS|266B]the God who hath been
[GNSS|266C]my shepherd all my life
[GNSS|266D]long unto this day, 48,16
[GNSS|266E]the angel who hath
[GNSS|266F]redeemed me from all evil,
[GNSS|2670]bless the lads;


[GNSS|2671]and let my name be
[GNSS|2672]named in them,
[GNSS|2673]and the name
[GNSS|2674]of my fathers Abraham
[GNSS|2675]and Isaac;


[GNSS|2676]and let them grow into
[GNSS|2677]a multitude in
[GNSS|2678]the midst of
[GNSS|2679]the earth.' 48,17
[GNSS|267A]And when Joseph saw that
[GNSS|267B]his father was
[GNSS|267C]laying his right hand upon
[GNSS|267D]the head of Ephraim, it
[GNSS|267E]displeased him, and he held
[GNSS|267F]up his father's hand, to
[GNSS|2680]remove it from Ephraim's head
[GNSS|2681]unto Manasseh's head.


[GNSS|2682]48,18 And Joseph
[GNSS|2683]said unto his father: 'Not
[GNSS|2684]so, my father,
[GNSS|2685]for this is
[GNSS|2686]the first-born;


[GNSS|2687]put thy right hand upon
[GNSS|2688]his head.' 48,19
[GNSS|2689]And his father refused,
[GNSS|268A]and said: 'I know it,
[GNSS|268B]my son, I know it;
[GNSS|268C]he also shall become
[GNSS|268D]a people, and he
[GNSS|268E]also shall be great;


[GNSS|268F]howbeit his younger brother shall
[GNSS|2690]be greater than he,
[GNSS|2691]and his seed shall become
[GNSS|2692]a multitude of nations.' 48,20
[GNSS|2693]And he blessed them that
[GNSS|2694]day, saying: 'By thee shall
[GNSS|2695]Israel bless, saying: God
[GNSS|2696]make thee as Ephraim
[GNSS|2697]and as Manasseh.'
[GNSS|2698]And he set Ephraim
[GNSS|2699]before Manasseh.


[GNSS|269A]48,21 And Israel
[GNSS|269B]said unto Joseph: 'Behold, I
[GNSS|269C]die;


[GNSS|269D]but God will be
[GNSS|269E]with you, and
[GNSS|269F]bring you back unto

[GNSS|26A1]48,22 Moreover I
[GNSS|26A2]have given to thee one

[GNSS|27B6]only their little ones,
[GNSS|27B7]and their flocks,
[GNSS|27B8]and their herds, they left
[GNSS|27B9]in the land
[GNSS|27BA]of Goshen.


[GNSS|27BB]50,9 And there
[GNSS|27BC]went up with him both
[GNSS|27BD]chariots and horsemen;


[GNSS|27BE]and it was
[GNSS|27BF]a very great company.


[GNSS|27C0]50,10 And they came to
[GNSS|27C1]the threshing-floor of Atad,
[GNSS|27C2]which is beyond
[GNSS|27C3]the Jordan, and there they
[GNSS|27C4]wailed with a very great
[GNSS|27C5]and sore wailing;


[GNSS|27C6]and he made
[GNSS|27C7]a mourning for his father
[GNSS|27C8]seven days.


[GNSS|27C9]50,11 And when
[GNSS|27CA]the inhabitants of
[GNSS|27CB]the land, the Canaanites, saw
[GNSS|27CC]the mourning in
[GNSS|27CD]the floor of Atad, they
[GNSS|27CE]said: 'This is
[GNSS|27CF]a grievous mourning to
[GNSS|27D0]the Egyptians.' Wherefore
[GNSS|27D1]the name of it was
[GNSS|27D2]called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond
[GNSS|27D3]the Jordan.


[GNSS|27D4]50,12 And his sons did
[GNSS|27D5]unto him according
[GNSS|27D6]as he commanded them.


[GNSS|27D7]50,13 For his sons
[GNSS|27D8]carried him into
[GNSS|27D9]the land of Canaan,
[GNSS|27DA]and buried him in
[GNSS|27DB]the cave of
[GNSS|27DC]the field of Machpelah,
[GNSS|27DD]which Abraham bought
[GNSS|27DE]with the field,
[GNSS|27DF]for a possession
[GNSS|27E0]of a burying-place,
[GNSS|27E1]of Ephron the Hittite, in
[GNSS|27E2]front of Mamre.


[GNSS|27E3]50,14 And Joseph
[GNSS|27E4]returned into Egypt, he,
[GNSS|27E5]and his brethren,
[GNSS|27E6]and all that
[GNSS|27E7]went up with him to
[GNSS|27E8]bury his father,
[GNSS|27E9]after he had
[GNSS|27EA]buried his father.


[GNSS|27EB]50,15 And when Joseph's brethren
[GNSS|27EC]saw that their father was
[GNSS|27ED]dead, they said: 'It may
[GNSS|27EE]be that Joseph
[GNSS|27EF]will hate us,
[GNSS|27F0]and will fully requite us
[GNSS|27F1]all the evil
[GNSS|27F2]which we did unto him.'
[GNSS|27F3]50,16 And they sent
[GNSS|27F4]a message unto Joseph, saying:
[GNSS|27F5]'Thy father did command
[GNSS|27F6]before he died, saying: 50,17
[GNSS|27F7]So shall ye
[GNSS|27F8]say unto Joseph: Forgive, I
[GNSS|27F9]pray thee now,
[GNSS|27FA]the transgression of thy brethren,
[GNSS|27FB]and their sin,
[GNSS|27FC]for that they did unto
[GNSS|27FD]thee evil.


[GNSS|27FE]And now, we pray thee,
[GNSS|27FF]forgive the transgression
[GNSS|2800]of the servants
[GNSS|2801]of the God
[GNSS|2802]of thy father.'
[GNSS|2803]And Joseph wept
[GNSS|2804]when they spoke unto him.


[GNSS|2805]50,18 And his brethren
[GNSS|2806]also went and fell down
[GNSS|2807]before his face;


[GNSS|2808]and they said: 'Behold, we
[GNSS|2809]are thy bondmen.' 50,19
[GNSS|280A]And Joseph said unto them:
[GNSS|280B]'Fear not;


[GNSS|280C]for am I in
[GNSS|280D]the place of God? 50,20
[GNSS|280E]And as for you, ye
[GNSS|280F]meant evil against me;
[GNSS|2810]but God meant it
[GNSS|2811]for good, to
[GNSS|2812]bring to pass,
[GNSS|2813]as it is this day,
[GNSS|2814]to save much people alive.


[GNSS|2815]50,21 Now therefore fear ye
[GNSS|2816]not;


[GNSS|2817]I will sustain you,
[GNSS|2818]and your little ones.'
[GNSS|2819]And he comforted them,
[GNSS|281A]and spoke kindly unto them.


[GNSS|281B]50,22 And Joseph dwelt in
[GNSS|281C]Egypt, he, and his father's
[GNSS|281D]house;


[GNSS|281E]and Joseph lived
[GNSS|281F]a hundred and ten years.


[GNSS|2820]50,23 And Joseph saw Ephraim's
[GNSS|2821]children of the third generation;


[GNSS|2822]the children also
[GNSS|2823]of Machir the son
[GNSS|2824]of Manasseh were born upon
[GNSS|2825]Joseph's knees.


[GNSS|2826]50,24 And Joseph
[GNSS|2827]said unto his brethren: 'I
[GNSS|2828]die;


[GNSS|2829]but God will surely remember
[GNSS|282A]you, and bring you up
[GNSS|282B]out of this land unto
[GNSS|282C]the land which He swore
[GNSS|282D]to Abraham, to Isaac,
[GNSS|282E]and to Jacob.' 50,25
[GNSS|282F]And Joseph took an oath
[GNSS|2830]of the children
[GNSS|2831]of Israel, saying: 'God
[GNSS|2832]will surely remember you,
[GNSS|2833]and ye shall carry up
[GNSS|2834]my bones from hence.' 50,26
[GNSS|2835]So Joseph died,
[GNSS|2836]being a hundred
[GNSS|2837]and ten years old.


[GNSS|2838]And they embalmed him,
[GNSS|2839]and he was put in
[GNSS|283A]a coffin in Egypt.
