| 1   | **Kenyan-MOD-labelled crates observed** at alleged RSF depot, Khartoum area.                                                       | C(S) | C(S) | I(S) | C(M) | Real, repeated crate visuals argue against simple forgery.                                             |
| 2   | **Matching ammo tins** seen among weapons displayed by SAF.                                                                        | C(M) | C(M) | I(M) | C(M) | Presence in both RSF-associated depot and SAF display is compatible with movement/capture dynamics.    |
| 3   | **Geolocation to Salha, Omdurman (15.5479, 32.4273)**.                                                                             | ND   | ND   | ND   | ND   | Anchors place/time; doesn’t choose a supply chain.                                                     |
| 4   | **Posting window May 19–21; SAF “full control” on May 20.**                                                                        | ND   | ND   | ND   | ND   | Time bounds constrain sequences but don’t distinguish chain causality.                                 |
| 5   | **Kenya MoD denies recognizing crates/inscriptions; cites KOFC records & frequent audits.**                                        | I(M) | ND   | C(M) | ND   | Official denial pushes against H1; audits imply traceability if obtained.                              |
| 6   | **Expert reads**: labels consistent with **Contract 23PTI / KEMOD-01**; 14.5×114 API; many crates delivered during/after **2024**. | C(S) | C(S) | I(S) | ND   | Specific contract codes & 2024 packing undercut pure forgery scenarios.                                |
| 7   | **UN Darfur arms-embargo (2005) remains in force.**                                                                                | I(W) | C(W) | ND   | ND   | Legal friction for direct supply; diversion narratives fit embargo evasion patterns.                   |
| 8   | **NGO reporting: multi-country weapons in Sudan** (incl. UAE).                                                                     | ND   | C(W) | ND   | ND   | Background plausibility for intermediary flows.                                                        |
| 9   | **Attributed claims**: UAE flights via Amdjarass; “Kenya used as hub”; $1.5B UAE-backed loan; $500M first tranche noted.           | C(W) | C(M) | ND   | ND   | Allegations support both H1 (broad “support”) and H2 (intermediated route); treat as claims, not fact. |

### Tally (disconfirmers highlighted)

- **H1 (Direct supply)** → **Inconsistents:** Row 5 (MoD denial), Row 7 (embargo friction) → *2 I* (M + W). **Support:** Rows 1,2,6 (+9 weak).

- **H2 (Diversion/intermediated)** → **Inconsistents:** *0 I*. **Support:** Rows 1,2,6; context Rows 7–9.

- **H3 (Forgery/misapplied labels)** → **Inconsistents:** Rows 1,2,6 → *3 I* (two strong + one moderate).

- **H4 (Capture/transfer)** → **Inconsistents:** *0 I*. **Support:** Rows 1–2 (movement plausible); however lacks a **specific capture chain** → largely ND elsewhere.

**Preliminary outcome (ACH rule: fewest disconfirmers):**

- **H3** is **least plausible** (multiple strong disconfirmers).

- **H1 vs H2 vs H4** remain viable; **H2** has **zero disconfirmers** and multiple consistencies → **current front-runner**. **H4** also has zero disconfirmers but weaker unique predictions (needs concrete capture evidence). **H1** remains possible but is weakened by official denials and embargo friction.

### What would flip the matrix? (collection requirements keyed to rows)

- **Row 6/Contract pathing**: Obtain **KOFC lot/packing records** for *Contract 23PTI / KEMOD-01* (consignee, shipper, transit points, dates). Decisive for **H1 vs H2**.

- **Row 5/Audit trail**: Independent access to **KOFC audit logs** & **MoD shipment registers**; reconcile crate IDs ↔ lot numbers. If logs exclude these lots, **H1** weakens further.

- **Row 4/source video lineage**: **Uncut, source-camera files** + metadata to tighten the **May 19–21** window and exclude staging/edit chains (guards against H3 variants).

- **Row 9/logistics corroboration**: **ATC/ADS-B** bundles for **Amdjarass/Khartoum** corridors aligned to 2024 packing signals; any **bill of lading / airwaybill** tying crate codes to routes (splits **H1 vs H2**).

- **H4 discriminator**: **Chain-of-custody imagery/docs** linking **SAF possession → RSF possession** (or reverse), dated to the posting window, to validate **capture/transfer**.
