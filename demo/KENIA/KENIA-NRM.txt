[KENIA|0001]Kenyan Weapons Linked to Sudan’s
[KENIA|0002]Civil War June 15,
[KENIA|0003]2025 Conflict Kenya
[KENIA|0004]Bellingcat and our partners at
[KENIA|0005]Kenya’s Daily Nation
[KENIA|0006]have identified Kenyan-labelled crates
[KENIA|0007]of ammunition inside an
[KENIA|0008]alleged RSF depot close to
[KENIA|0009]the recently recaptured Sudanese capital
[KENIA|000A]Khartoum.


[KENIA|000B]Although we couldn’t independently verify
[KENIA|000C]the contents of every crate
[KENIA|000D]identified, tins with ammunition
[KENIA|000E]matching the labels on
[KENIA|000F]the crates were found nearby
[KENIA|0010]among the captured weapons
[KENIA|0011]displayed by the Sudanese
[KENIA|0012]Armed Forces (SAF).


[KENIA|0013]The confirmation of ammunition crates
[KENIA|0014]inside Sudan raises new questions
[KENIA|0015]about Kenya’s involvement in
[KENIA|0016]the conflict following
[KENIA|0017]a high-profile visit
[KENIA|0018]by Rapid Support Forces leader
[KENIA|0019]General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo to
[KENIA|001A]Nairobi earlier this year.


[KENIA|001B]In response to
[KENIA|001C]the visit, the Sudanese government
[KENIA|001D]banned all imports from Kenya
[KENIA|001E]amid a perception
[KENIA|001F]of close ties between
[KENIA|0020]the Ruto government
[KENIA|0021]and General Dagalo, widely known
[KENIA|0022]as Hemedti.


[KENIA|0023]The Kenyan government
[KENIA|0024]defended the decision to host
[KENIA|0025]Hemedti, stating that their aim
[KENIA|0026]was to promote dialogue
[KENIA|0027]and peace and
[KENIA|0028]emphasising the importance
[KENIA|0029]of engaging all parties
[KENIA|002A]involved in the conflict.


[KENIA|002B]Examples of images
[KENIA|002C]of Kenyan MOD-labelled ammunition crates.


[KENIA|002D]These images had been
[KENIA|002E]circulating on social media, allegedly
[KENIA|002F]showing ammunition left behind
[KENIA|0030]by the RSF.

[KENIA|0032]While the Kenya Ordnance Factories
[KENIA|0033]Corporation (KOFC) states on its
[KENIA|0034]website that it produces small
[KENIA|0035]arms ammunition, it does
[KENIA|0036]not indicate manufacturing higher-calibre 14.5×114
[KENIA|0037]mm cartridges and
[KENIA|0038]the Chinese-made HE PP87 mortar
[KENIA|0039]bombs identified in this investigation.


[KENIA|003A]Our partners at
[KENIA|003B]Daily Nation reached out to
[KENIA|003C]the Ministry of Defence (MoD)
[KENIA|003D]of Kenya to ask about
[KENIA|003E]the crates we
[KENIA|003F]identified and how they
[KENIA|0040]ended up in Sudan.


[KENIA|0041]We also asked
[KENIA|0042]whether it was Kenyan government
[KENIA|0043]policy to supply ammunition
[KENIA|0044]or weapons to
[KENIA|0045]the Rapid Support Forces
[KENIA|0046]and how this comports
[KENIA|0047]with the government’s public commitment
[KENIA|0048]to facilitating peace
[KENIA|0049]and dialogue in Sudan.


[KENIA|004A]Support Bellingcat Your donations
[KENIA|004B]directly contribute to our ability
[KENIA|004C]to publish groundbreaking investigations
[KENIA|004D]and uncover wrongdoing around
[KENIA|004E]the world.


[KENIA|004F]Donate In its response,
[KENIA|0050]the Ministry of Defence
[KENIA|0051]said it did
[KENIA|0052]not recognise the crates
[KENIA|0053]or labels on them
[KENIA|0054]and distanced itself from
[KENIA|0055]the allegations.


[KENIA|0056]Its answer appears to be
[KENIA|0057]limited to nationally
[KENIA|0058]produced ammunition only
[KENIA|0059]as well as internal protocols.


[KENIA|005A]It didn’t mention
[KENIA|005B]if Kenya has done any
[KENIA|005C]imports, international transfers
[KENIA|005D]or diversions of
[KENIA|005E]the weapons or ammunition in
[KENIA|005F]question.


[KENIA|0060]A statement that leaves key
[KENIA|0061]concerns about the Sudan connection
[KENIA|0062]unclear.


[KENIA|0063]“Upon examination of
[KENIA|0064]the photographs provided, we wish
[KENIA|0065]to state that we
[KENIA|0066]do not recognize
[KENIA|0067]the crates nor
[KENIA|0068]the inscriptions on them.


[KENIA|0069]The Kenya Ordinance Factory Corporation
[KENIA|006A]and, by extension,
[KENIA|006B]the Ministry is alive to
[KENIA|006C]the sensitive nature
[KENIA|006D]of the ammunition it manufactures,
[KENIA|006E]and as a result, it
[KENIA|006F]has clear records
[KENIA|0070]of its supplies within
[KENIA|0071]and beyond Kenya.


[KENIA|0072]Alongside this, and to guarantee
[KENIA|0073]public safety, audits
[KENIA|0074]of the factory’s operations are
[KENIA|0075]frequently conducted by
[KENIA|0076]the managing and external oversight
[KENIA|0077]authorities.


[KENIA|0078]The Ministry of Defence, therefore,
[KENIA|0079]distances itself from
[KENIA|007A]the allegations you sent earlier.


[KENIA|007B]Further, we remain fully
[KENIA|007C]committed to upholding
[KENIA|007D]the rule of law
[KENIA|007E]and continue to operate strictly
[KENIA|007F]within the mandate
[KENIA|0080]granted by the Constitution
[KENIA|0081]and applicable authorizations.” 
[KENIA|0082]Justin Lynch, Managing Director
[KENIA|0083]of the Conflict Insights Group
[KENIA|0084]and a Sudan researcher, told
[KENIA|0085]Bellingcat the discovery
[KENIA|0086]of the crates is further
[KENIA|0087]evidence of Kenya’s political
[KENIA|0088]and logistical support
[KENIA|0089]for the RSF.


[KENIA|008A]A Country at War, Awash
[KENIA|008B]with Foreign Weapons Sudan
[KENIA|008C]is in the midst
[KENIA|008D]of an ongoing civil war
[KENIA|008E]between two rival factions,
[KENIA|008F]the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF)
[KENIA|0090]and the paramilitary Rapid Support
[KENIA|0091]Forces (RSF).


[KENIA|0092]The stash of ammunition crates
[KENIA|0093]located near Sudan’s capital was
[KENIA|0094]filmed by Sudanese
[KENIA|0095]Armed Forces (SAF) soldiers
[KENIA|0096]who took part in
[KENIA|0097]the final push to retake
[KENIA|0098]the city from
[KENIA|0099]the RSF who
[KENIA|009A]have controlled Khartoum
[KENIA|009B]and its surrounding cities
[KENIA|009C]for much of
[KENIA|009D]the civil war.


[KENIA|009E]The SAF declared it
[KENIA|009F]had retaken the final areas
[KENIA|00A0]of resistance in Khartoum, its
[KENIA|00A1]twin city of Omdurman,
[KENIA|00A2]and the neighbouring city
[KENIA|00A3]of Bahri on May 20,
[KENIA|00A4]stating the three areas were
[KENIA|00A5]now completely free
[KENIA|00A6]of RSF forces.


[KENIA|00A7]The re-taking of
[KENIA|00A8]the capital has led to
[KENIA|00A9]much footage and images
[KENIA|00AA]being released.


[KENIA|00AB]Including footage that appears to
[KENIA|00AC]show supplies used
[KENIA|00AD]by the RSF.


[KENIA|00AE]A 2005 UN arms embargo
[KENIA|00AF]remains in place
[KENIA|00B0]prohibiting any country from
[KENIA|00B1]supplying weapons to Darfur, Sudan,
[KENIA|00B2]an area that
[KENIA|00B3]has seen intense
[KENIA|00B4]fighting since the outbreak
[KENIA|00B5]of the civil war.


[KENIA|00B6]However both Amnesty International
[KENIA|00B7]and Human Rights Watch
[KENIA|00B8]have identified weapons
[KENIA|00B9]produced in China, Iran, Russia,
[KENIA|00BA]Serbia and the UAE
[KENIA|00BB]being used in
[KENIA|00BC]the conflict.


[KENIA|00BD]The Sudanese government brought
[KENIA|00BE]a case before
[KENIA|00BF]the International Court
[KENIA|00C0]of Justice in
[KENIA|00C1]The Hague in May,
[KENIA|00C2]accusing the UAE
[KENIA|00C3]of complicity in genocide
[KENIA|00C4]for its role in
[KENIA|00C5]supporting the RSF.


[KENIA|00C6]The UAE has categorically
[KENIA|00C7]denied supporting the RSF.


[KENIA|00C8]The case was
[KENIA|00C9]dismissed as the UAE
[KENIA|00CA]has not signed Article 9
[KENIA|00CB]of the Genocide Convention.


[KENIA|00CC]Both sides of
[KENIA|00CD]the conflict have been
[KENIA|00CE]accused of war crimes,
[KENIA|00CF]and the RSF
[KENIA|00D0]has been accused
[KENIA|00D1]of ethnic cleansing in certain
[KENIA|00D2]areas, including around Darfur.


[KENIA|00D3]The UN says
[KENIA|00D4]more than 24,000 people
[KENIA|00D5]have been killed
[KENIA|00D6]since fighting began in 2023
[KENIA|00D7]following a peaceful
[KENIA|00D8]uprising by civilians against dictator
[KENIA|00D9]Omar al-Bashir.


[KENIA|00DA]More than 11 million people
[KENIA|00DB]have reportedly been displaced.


[KENIA|00DC]While there is
[KENIA|00DD]detailed reporting on routes between
[KENIA|00DE]the UAE and Sudan’s
[KENIA|00DF]neighbouring countries, including Chad,
[KENIA|00E0]being used for weapons transfers,
[KENIA|00E1]specific details about
[KENIA|00E2]how the Kenyan ammunition crates
[KENIA|00E3]ended up in
[KENIA|00E4]the country remain scarce.


[KENIA|00E5]How Do We Know
[KENIA|00E6]the Ammunition Crates Were in
[KENIA|00E7]the Vicinity of Khartoum? 
[KENIA|00E8]On May 19,
[KENIA|00E9]after weeks of
[KENIA|00EA]reported intense fighting
[KENIA|00EB]with the RSF, SAF soldiers
[KENIA|00EC]and allied forces
[KENIA|00ED]posted video clips
[KENIA|00EE]claiming they were inside
[KENIA|00EF]the Salha area in southern
[KENIA|00F0]Omdurman, located across
[KENIA|00F1]the Nile from Khartoum.


[KENIA|00F2]Bellingcat and Daily Nation
[KENIA|00F3]have identified three videos
[KENIA|00F4]containing Kenyan MOD-labelled ammunition crates
[KENIA|00F5]allegedly left behind
[KENIA|00F6]by the RSF inside an
[KENIA|00F7]unknown depot most likely in
[KENIA|00F8]Salha.


[KENIA|00F9]Using social media, we
[KENIA|00FA]identified soldiers seen in
[KENIA|00FB]the depot next to
[KENIA|00FC]the ammunition: A Major from
[KENIA|00FD]the SAF’s General Intelligence Service
[KENIA|00FE](GIS) and at least one
[KENIA|00FF]other young Sudanese soldier.


[KENIA|0100]Both appear to
[KENIA|0101]have been in
[KENIA|0102]the depot during
[KENIA|0103]the same time
[KENIA|0104]the operation in Salha was
[KENIA|0105]taking place.


[KENIA|0106]Video 1, Video 2
[KENIA|0107]and Video 3 show soldiers
[KENIA|0108]rummaging through several rooms
[KENIA|0109]containing crates and
[KENIA|010A]talking about the armour allegedly
[KENIA|010B]left behind by
[KENIA|010C]the RSF.


[KENIA|010D]Photos of the same type
[KENIA|010E]of crates with
[KENIA|010F]the same label from
[KENIA|0110]the Kenyan MOD
[KENIA|0111]had been circulating on social
[KENIA|0112]media for some
[KENIA|0113]time earlier this year.


[KENIA|0114]But it had been difficult
[KENIA|0115]to geolocate inside Sudan
[KENIA|0116]before these more recent videos
[KENIA|0117]emerged.


[KENIA|0118]In video 3,
[KENIA|0119]the speaker mentions
[KENIA|011A]the ammunition discovery
[KENIA|011B]and repeats ‘Salha’,
[KENIA|011C]the location, several times.


[KENIA|011D]In video 1, an Arabic
[KENIA|011E]speaker can be heard saying:
[KENIA|011F]“But I swear to God,
[KENIA|0120]you can’t fight
[KENIA|0121]again and you won’t defeat
[KENIA|0122]us, is this
[KENIA|0123]the work (equipment) you leave?”
[KENIA|0124]Above: Example of one
[KENIA|0125]of the crates
[KENIA|0126]featured in one
[KENIA|0127]of the videos
[KENIA|0128]filmed inside the dark depot.


[KENIA|0129]Below: The stencil label appears
[KENIA|012A]to be the same
[KENIA|012B]as seen in other previous
[KENIA|012C]pictures circulating earlier on social
[KENIA|012D]media.

[KENIA|012F]shows a man inside
[KENIA|0130]the depot wearing
[KENIA|0131]a fatigued t-shirt, glasses
[KENIA|0132]and white Tasbih prayer beads.


[KENIA|0133]We found further footage
[KENIA|0134]showing what appears to be
[KENIA|0135]the same man
[KENIA|0136]wearing the same clothes
[KENIA|0137]and accessories.


[KENIA|0138]Elements in the background tell
[KENIA|0139]us that the video was
[KENIA|013A]indeed filmed in Salha, Omdurman,
[KENIA|013B]along the main road (15.5479,
[KENIA|013C]32.4273).

[KENIA|0144]occasion in an outdoor setting.

[KENIA|0146]The outdoor setting was

[KENIA|0148]32.4273).


[KENIA|0149]Credit: Facebook, Google Earth 
[KENIA|014A]We identified the soldier above
[KENIA|014B]as a Major (Ra’id) from
[KENIA|014C]the SAF’s General Intelligence Service,
[KENIA|014D]as indicated by his uniform
[KENIA|014E]insignias and patches seen in
[KENIA|014F]another video circulating on May
[KENIA|0150]20.


[KENIA|0151]His name appears to be
[KENIA|0152]Al-Makki Abdul Quddus Ahmed.


[KENIA|0153]A video showing
[KENIA|0154]a man with
[KENIA|0155]the same characteristics
[KENIA|0156]as the soldier from
[KENIA|0157]the depot is
[KENIA|0158]wearing a uniform
[KENIA|0159]featuring an insignia consistent
[KENIA|015A]with a Rai’d/Major rank used
[KENIA|015B]by the Sudanese
[KENIA|015C]Armed Forces and
[KENIA|015D]a patch from
[KENIA|015E]the General Intelligence Service
[KENIA|015F]of Sudan.


[KENIA|0160]Using Optical Character Recognition, his
[KENIA|0161]name appears to read Al-Makki
[KENIA|0162]Abdul Quddus Ahmed.

[KENIA|0164]Similarly, in another video
[KENIA|0165]filmed approx 150m from Major
[KENIA|0166]Al-Makki, here (15.546947, 32.427022), we
[KENIA|0167]identified a second man seen
[KENIA|0168]in the ammunition depot videos.


[KENIA|0169]In both videos, he is
[KENIA|016A]seen wearing the same clothes
[KENIA|016B]with a small Sudanese flag
[KENIA|016C]on his left shoulder.


[KENIA|016D]A young soldier
[KENIA|016E]who was in
[KENIA|016F]the ammo depot was
[KENIA|0170]also seen outdoors in
[KENIA|0171]a street scene
[KENIA|0172]celebrating with other soldiers
[KENIA|0173]and wearing the same outfit
[KENIA|0174]and accessories as in
[KENIA|0175]the depot.


[KENIA|0176]We geolocated the young soldier
[KENIA|0177]just 150m from Major Al-Makki
[KENIA|0178]in Salha, Omdurman.


[KENIA|0179]Credit: Facebook/Google Earth Pro 
[KENIA|017A]All the videos
[KENIA|017B]analysed were posted between May
[KENIA|017C]19 and May 21.


[KENIA|017D]We geolocated the soldiers in
[KENIA|017E]a market area
[KENIA|017F]of southern Omdurman’s Salha district.


[KENIA|0180]This is consistent
[KENIA|0181]with the Sudanese
[KENIA|0182]Armed Forces retaking
[KENIA|0183]the city.


[KENIA|0184]Aljazeera reported that SAF
[KENIA|0185]had regained full control
[KENIA|0186]of the area
[KENIA|0187]by May 20.


[KENIA|0188]Although we were unable to
[KENIA|0189]confirm the exact location
[KENIA|018A]of the depot,
[KENIA|018B]corroborating the presence
[KENIA|018C]of soldiers in
[KENIA|018D]the Salha area, along
[KENIA|018E]with open source information, strongly
[KENIA|018F]indicates that the depot is
[KENIA|0190]indeed located in
[KENIA|0191]the Salha neighbourhood
[KENIA|0192]of Omdurman.


[KENIA|0193]From Sudan to
[KENIA|0194]the World: International Connections
[KENIA|0195]of the Weapons Crates 
[KENIA|0196]We compared the labels
[KENIA|0197]of the crates
[KENIA|0198]located near the Khartoum depot
[KENIA|0199]with other images
[KENIA|019A]of Kenyan munition crates
[KENIA|019B]circulating online, reportedly
[KENIA|019C]also from Sudan.


[KENIA|019D]On the labels, we
[KENIA|019E]can see English
[KENIA|019F]wording that includes
[KENIA|01A0]the name of
[KENIA|01A1]the product, contract number, batch
[KENIA|01A2]number, quantity, volume, case number
[KENIA|01A3]and total case number.


[KENIA|01A4]To be clear,
[KENIA|01A5]although the crates are
[KENIA|01A6]labelled with contractual
[KENIA|01A7]and technical information, we are
[KENIA|01A8]not able to
[KENIA|01A9]say with certainty
[KENIA|01AA]the origin or producer
[KENIA|01AB]of the munitions.


[KENIA|01AC]However, there are important details
[KENIA|01AD]to highlight.


[KENIA|01AE]Bellingcat and our partners at
[KENIA|01AF]Daily Nation shared images
[KENIA|01B0]of the crates
[KENIA|01B1]with three independent armament experts.


[KENIA|01B2]All confirmed that
[KENIA|01B3]the markings indicated
[KENIA|01B4]the ammunition crates were part
[KENIA|01B5]of the same contract (No.


[KENIA|01B6]23PTI) and were
[KENIA|01B7]delivered to the Kenyan Ministry
[KENIA|01B8]of Defence (KEMOD-01).


[KENIA|01B9]Australian-based Armament Research Services (ARES)
[KENIA|01BA]told us: “The markings on
[KENIA|01BB]this crate are consistent
[KENIA|01BC]with other crates we
[KENIA|01BD]have seen that we believe
[KENIA|01BE]to be delivered on
[KENIA|01BF]a Kenyan contract.” 
[KENIA|01C0]Still of video
[KENIA|01C1]showing Kenyan MOD-labelled ammunition crates.

[KENIA|01C4]showing ammunition allegedly
[KENIA|01C5]captured by SAF in Khartoum.


[KENIA|01C6]Credit: X, Sudan Nabaa 
[KENIA|01C7]Upon examining the images,
[KENIA|01C8]the weapons experts
[KENIA|01C9]also told us that many
[KENIA|01CA]of the crates indicate delivery
[KENIA|01CB]during or after 2024 –
[KENIA|01CC]when the civil war in
[KENIA|01CD]Sudan was well underway.


[KENIA|01CE]Former Royal Artillery Army officer
[KENIA|01CF]and director of Chiron Resources,
[KENIA|01D0]Chris Cobb-Smith said: “The batch
[KENIA|01D1]number suggests they were
[KENIA|01D2]packed in 2024 – delivery
[KENIA|01D3]date to Kenya
[KENIA|01D4]would probably have been
[KENIA|01D5]the same year.


[KENIA|01D6]When delivered to Sudan is
[KENIA|01D7]not known.”  
[KENIA|01D8]All three experts
[KENIA|01D9]agreed that the type
[KENIA|01DA]of ammunition indicated on
[KENIA|01DB]the labels was 57 calibre
[KENIA|01DC](14.5×114mm) armour-piercing incendiary (API) cartridges.


[KENIA|01DD]Cobb said that 14.5×114mm (.57
[KENIA|01DE]calibre) is a heavy machine
[KENIA|01DF]gun and anti-material rifle cartridge
[KENIA|01E0]used by the Soviet Union,
[KENIA|01E1]the former Warsaw Pact states,
[KENIA|01E2]modern Russia, and other countries.


[KENIA|01E3]Although not specified on
[KENIA|01E4]the crates, Cobb
[KENIA|01E5]added that this type
[KENIA|01E6]of cartridge has been
[KENIA|01E7]manufactured in Bulgaria, China, Egypt,
[KENIA|01E8]Hungary, Iraq, North Korea, Poland,
[KENIA|01E9]Romania, Russia, and
[KENIA|01EA]the former Czechoslovakia.


[KENIA|01EB]One of the videos we
[KENIA|01EC]found with these crates inside
[KENIA|01ED]a depot in Salha, Omdurman,
[KENIA|01EE]showed cans inside
[KENIA|01EF]the crates and at least
[KENIA|01F0]one open can
[KENIA|01F1]next to the crates
[KENIA|01F2]had visible ammunition consistent
[KENIA|01F3]with the specifications on
[KENIA|01F4]the label.


[KENIA|01F5]The ammunition visible appears to
[KENIA|01F6]have a green case
[KENIA|01F7]and what appears to be
[KENIA|01F8]a standard black-tip.


[KENIA|01F9]Several cans were visible inside
[KENIA|01FA]crates in the depot.


[KENIA|01FB]At least one open
[KENIA|01FC]can located next to
[KENIA|01FD]the crates had visible ammunition
[KENIA|01FE]consistent with the specs on
[KENIA|01FF]the label.

[KENIA|020D]were also able to identify
[KENIA|020E]two additional green crates seen
[KENIA|020F]in a video
[KENIA|0210]showing the Salha depot.


[KENIA|0211]The label appears to indicate
[KENIA|0212]the boxes likely contain (or
[KENIA|0213]at least contained) an explosive
[KENIA|0214]with the specification “82mm HE
[KENIA|0215]Mortar Bomb Type PP87”.


[KENIA|0216]Two additional green crates are
[KENIA|0217]seen in one
[KENIA|0218]of the videos
[KENIA|0219]showing the Salha depot.


[KENIA|021A]The label on
[KENIA|021B]the Kenyan-labelled crate reads 82
[KENIA|021C]mm HE Mortar Bomb Type
[KENIA|021D]PP87.


[KENIA|021E]Credit: X 
[KENIA|021F]According to weapons experts,
[KENIA|0220]the markings on
[KENIA|0221]the crate suggest
[KENIA|0222]the box and its contents
[KENIA|0223]were likely initially
[KENIA|0224]delivered to Kenyan authorities under
[KENIA|0225]contract AMI/KEN/099/2023.


[KENIA|0226]Director of Chiron Resources, Chris
[KENIA|0227]Cobb-Smith told Bellingcat that
[KENIA|0228]the contract number on these
[KENIA|0229]crates indicates the Kenyan MOD
[KENIA|022A]purchased mortar bombs from China
[KENIA|022B]in 2023.


[KENIA|022C]He added that it
[KENIA|022D]would be impossible to
[KENIA|022E]say whether they were
[KENIA|022F]immediately diverted or not.


[KENIA|0230]Human Rights Watch
[KENIA|0231]reported in 2024 that RSF
[KENIA|0232]appeared to be
[KENIA|0233]using this Chinese-made mortar ammunition.


[KENIA|0234]This video shows
[KENIA|0235]a man in RSF camouflage
[KENIA|0236]and another in civilian clothes
[KENIA|0237]unpacking 82mm HE Mortar Bomb
[KENIA|0238]Type PP87.


[KENIA|0239]HRW was unable to verify
[KENIA|023A]RSF claims that it
[KENIA|023B]captured this new mortar munition
[KENIA|023C]from the SAF.


[KENIA|023D]Amnesty International has
[KENIA|023E]also reported the use
[KENIA|023F]of this weapon in Sudan.

[KENIA|024A]May in Khartoum.


[KENIA|024B]The Chinese-made bomb was
[KENIA|024C]photographed next to another Kenyan
[KENIA|024D]labelled crate stating it
[KENIA|024E]contained 7.62mm SMG (submachine guns
[KENIA|024F]or self-loaded rifles) TYPE CS/LR11-
[KENIA|0250]sold by the intermediary China

[KENIA|025D]There have been
[KENIA|025E]several reports identifying Chinese-made weapons
[KENIA|025F]in the arms
[KENIA|0260]of the RSF.


[KENIA|0261]In April, China’s charge d’affaires
[KENIA|0262]in Port Sudan was
[KENIA|0263]summoned by the Sudanese government
[KENIA|0264]over the RSF’s use
[KENIA|0265]of Chinese-made drones.


[KENIA|0266]China has stressed they
[KENIA|0267]have “nothing to
[KENIA|0268]do with the presence
[KENIA|0269]of these drones
[KENIA|026A]and has no connection
[KENIA|026B]with the RSF”.


[KENIA|026C]Earlier this month Sudanese media
[KENIA|026D]outlet Ayin used open sources
[KENIA|026E]to identify Chinese-made weapons in
[KENIA|026F]the hands of RSF fighters.

[KENIA|0274]the Engineering Corps
[KENIA|0275]building in Omdurman (15.609734, 32.480369),
[KENIA|0276]similar crates were seen
[KENIA|0277]but with the stencil label
[KENIA|0278]removed.

[KENIA|027E]Next to the crates,
[KENIA|027F]a green box is seen
[KENIA|0280]with a stencil label that
[KENIA|0281]appears to read: 
[KENIA|0282]“Direction Générale de la réserve
[KENIA|0283]Stratégique de la Présidence …
[KENIA|0284]République du Tchad”: General Directorate
[KENIA|0285]of Strategic Reserves (DGRS)
[KENIA|0286]of the Presidency… Republic
[KENIA|0287]of Chad.


[KENIA|0288]The label on this box
[KENIA|0289]indicates a different designation 
[KENIA|028A]“73-DTG02”.


[KENIA|028B]According to the Collective Awareness
[KENIA|028C]to Unexploded Ordnance (CAT-UXO), this
[KENIA|028D]designation is believed to be
[KENIA|028E]a Chinese 73mm High-Explosive-Dual-Purpose (HEDP),
[KENIA|028F]High-Explosive-Anti-Tank (HEAT) with Anti-Personnel (AP)
[KENIA|0290]HE-Frag, fin-stabilised Rocket.


[KENIA|0291]The UAE has been
[KENIA|0292]accused of supplying Sudan’s RSF
[KENIA|0293]via a Chad airstrip.


[KENIA|0294]Dozens of flights from
[KENIA|0295]the UAE appear to
[KENIA|0296]have used an airstrip at
[KENIA|0297]Amdjarass in eastern Chad
[KENIA|0298]since the war began in
[KENIA|0299]April 2023.


[KENIA|029A]Weapons Continue to Fuel
[KENIA|029B]Suffering The discovery
[KENIA|029C]of the Kenyan-labelled munitions crates
[KENIA|029D]is further evidence
[KENIA|029E]of Kenya’s political
[KENIA|029F]and logistical support to
[KENIA|02A0]the RSF, Justin Lynch,
[KENIA|02A1]Managing Director of Conflict Insights
[KENIA|02A2]Group and Sudan researcher, told
[KENIA|02A3]Bellingcat.


[KENIA|02A4]He said the UAE
[KENIA|02A5]has used Kenya
[KENIA|02A6]and other African states
[KENIA|02A7]as a political
[KENIA|02A8]and logistical hub to support
[KENIA|02A9]the Rapid Support Forces.


[KENIA|02AA]“It seems hardly
[KENIA|02AB]a coincidence that RSF public
[KENIA|02AC]conferences in Nairobi were
[KENIA|02AD]immediately followed by
[KENIA|02AE]a $1.5 billion loan from
[KENIA|02AF]the UAE and
[KENIA|02B0]a surge in suspicious UAE-to-RSF
[KENIA|02B1]shipments transiting through Kenya,” Lynch
[KENIA|02B2]said.


[KENIA|02B3]Kenya is reported to draw
[KENIA|02B4]down next week
[KENIA|02B5]the first portion
[KENIA|02B6]of $500 million from
[KENIA|02B7]the $1.5 billion
[KENIA|02B8]United Arab Emirates (UAE) –
[KENIA|02B9]backed commercial loan.

[KENIA|02C7]losing control of

[KENIA|02D4]who is providing weapons
[KENIA|02D5]and support to
